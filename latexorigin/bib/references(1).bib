	abstract = {, This paper presents an experimental study on the mechanism of interaction between a cavitation bubble and an air bubble. The cavitation bubble was generated by means of the low-voltage discharge method, and the combination of high-speed photography and a pressure measurement system allowed for simultaneous observation and measurement of the evolution of the shock wave and the change in shock wave strength with the presence of the air bubble in the vicinity. The high-speed imaging revealed the predominant roles of the relative distance φ and relative size ε between the cavitation and air bubbles in the determination of the stratification effect that the air bubble exerted on the shock wave produced from the first collapse of the cavitation bubble. The pressure measurement indicated that, when the air bubble did not merge with the cavitation bubble, the aforementioned factors, together with the angle αα{\textbackslash}alpha  formed by the air bubble, cavitation bubble and the measuring point, would jointly affect the attenuation of the pressure peak and energy of the shock wave. Quantitatively, the attenuation magnitude was proportional to a(αφ/ε)ba(αφ/ε)ba\{({\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}varphi /{\textbackslash}varepsilon ){\textasciicircum}b\}, where the values of the coefficients a and b depended on whether the shock wave was stratified or not. When the cavitation bubble and the air bubble merged, the energy and the pressure peak of the shock wave decreased to less than 40 \% of the values in the absence of the air bubble. With the new insight into bubble–bubble interaction mechanisms, the findings will facilitate a better understanding and development of cavitation utilization and prevention technology in water--air two phase systems.},

	abstract = {The inception of a cavitation bubble in a liquid by focusing a short and intense laser pulse near its free surface develops not only an upwards directed jet, but a second jet of opposite direction into the bulk liquid. When the laser is focused a few microns below the surface, the rapid deposition of energy produces a splash, whose later sealing gives origin to two particularly elongated opposing jets. Interestingly, the evolution of the downward jet flowing into the liquid pool has many similarities to that observed in free water entry experiments, e.g. the creation of a slender and stable cavity in the liquid. The downward jet can reach speeds of up to \$40\$ m s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and travels distances of more than 15 times the maximum radius of the laser induced cavity before losing momentum. The longer lifetime of this so-called ‘bullet’ jet as compared with conventional cavitation based jets, the alignment of the jet perpendicular to the free surface and the possibility of scaling the phenomenon opens up potential applications when generated on small droplets or in shallow liquids. In this work, the underlying mechanisms behind the formation of the bullet jets are initially investigated by performing a set of experiments designed to address specific questions about the phenomenon under study. Those were followed by numerical simulations used to give a quantitative and detailed explanation to the experimental observations.},

	abstract = {This study gives insights into the interfacial instability of water droplets through a combination of laboratory experiments, numerical simulations and analytical modelling. An experiment is conducted in a narrow gap between two plates to model the two-dimensional cylindrical geometry, and a pulsed laser beam is focused inside a water droplet to generate a cavitation bubble. Three distinct characteristics of droplet deformation can be observed: (i) splashing; (ii) ventilating; and (iii) a stable state. In addition, an analytical model considering the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and bubble oscillation is developed based on the assumption that fluid is inviscid and incompressible. The analytical model is solved to obtain a phase diagram describing three distinct phenomena. Two dimensionless parameters, \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{ins\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{sta\}\$, are used to determine the boundaries between different regimes. The parameter \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{ins\}\$ is defined by the ratio of the perturbation amplitude to the difference between the droplet and bubble radii, whereas the other parameter \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{sta\}\$ is defined by the ratio of the perturbation amplitude to the initial droplet radius. Interfacial instability is induced when the perturbed droplet surface penetrates the bubble boundary, namely, \${\textbackslash}rvert {\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{ins\} {\textbackslash}rvert {\textbackslash}geq 1\$. Splashing and ventilating phenomena occur for \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{ins\}{\textbackslash}geq 1\$ and \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{ins\}{\textbackslash}leq -1\$, respectively. A stable state occurs when droplet fragmentation does not appear despite small-amplitude perturbations for \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{sta\}{\textbackslash}leq 0.1\$. There is a transition zone between the ventilating and stable state, which is bounded by \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{ins\} = -1\$ and \${\textbackslash}hat \{{\textbackslash}eta \}\_\{sta\} = 0.1\$. Finally, the phase diagram is verified by the experimental and numerical results.},

	abstract = {A cavitation bubble expanding and collapsing near a rigid boundary develops a directed jet ﬂow towards the boundary. In the case of a perforated plate, some of the jet ﬂow passes through the plate and thus the bubble acts as a pump transporting liquid from one side of the plate to the opposite side. The transport is rather complex, is time dependent and varies with the geometric parameters of the bubble and the connecting channel. Therefore, we ﬁrst model the transport of liquid through a perforated rigid plate for a large range of parameters and then compare some regimes with experiments using single laser-induced bubbles. The simulations are based on a Volume-of-Fluid solver in OpenFOAM and account for surface tension, compressibility and viscosity. The resulting ﬂux and generated velocity in the channel obtained in the simulations are discussed with regards to the dependence of the channel geometry, liquid viscosity and stand-off distance of the bubble to the plate. In general, high ﬂow rates are achieved for long cylindrical channels that have a similar width as the jet produced by the collapsing bubble. At low stand-off distances combined with thick plates, an annular inﬂow creates a fast and thin jet, also called needle jet, which is approximately a magnitude faster and signiﬁcantly thinner than the usually encountered microjet. In contrast, for thin plates and small stand-off distances, liquid is pumped in the opposite direction via a reverse jet.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the behaviour of a non-spherical cavitation bubble in an acoustic standing wave. The study has important applications to sonochemistry and in understanding features of therapeutic ultrasound in the megahertz range, extending our understanding of bubble behaviour in the highly nonlinear regime where jet and toroidal bubble formation may be important. The theory developed herein represents a further development of the material presented in Part 1 of this paper (Wang \& Blake, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 659, 2010, pp. 191–224) to a standing wave, including repeated topological changes from a singly to a multiply connected bubble. The ﬂuid mechanics is assumed to be compressible potential ﬂow. Matched asymptotic expansions for an inner and outer ﬂow are performed to second order in terms of a small parameter, the bubble-wall Mach number, leading to weakly compressible ﬂow formulation of the problem. The method allows the development of a computational model for nonspherical bubbles by using a modiﬁed boundary-integral method. The computations show that the bubble remains approximately of a spherical shape when the acoustic pressure is small or is initiated at the node or antinode of the acoustic pressure ﬁeld. When initiated between the node and antinode at higher acoustic pressures, the bubble loses its spherical shape at the end of the collapse phase after only a few oscillations. A high-speed liquid bubble jet forms and is directed towards the node, impacting the opposite bubble surface and penetrating through the bubble to form a toroidal bubble. The bubble ﬁrst rebounds in a toroidal form but re-combines to a singly connected bubble, expanding continuously and gradually returning to a near spherical shape. These processes are repeated in the next oscillation.},

	abstract = {Micro-cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasound have wide and important applications in medical ultrasonics and sonochemistry. An approximate theory is developed for nonlinear and non-spherical bubbles in a compressible liquid by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The perturbation is performed to the second order in terms of a small parameter, the bubble-wall Mach number. The inner ﬂow near the bubble can be approximated as incompressible at the ﬁrst and second orders, leading to the use of Laplace’s equation, whereas the outer ﬂow far away from the bubble can be described by the linear wave equation, also for the ﬁrst and second orders. Matching between the two expansions provides the model for the non-spherical bubble behaviour in a compressible ﬂuid. A numerical model using the mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian method and a modiﬁed boundary integral method is used to obtain the evolving bubble shapes. The primary advantage of this method is its computational eﬃciency over using the wave equation throughout the ﬂuid domain. The numerical model is validated against the Keller–Herring equation for spherical bubbles in weakly compressible liquids with excellent agreement being obtained for the bubble radius evolution up to the fourth oscillation. Numerical analyses are further performed for non-spherical oscillating acoustic bubbles. Bubble evolution and jet formation are simulated. Outputs also include the bubble volume, bubble displacement, Kelvin impulse and liquid jet tip velocity. Bubble behaviour is studied in terms of the wave frequency and amplitude. Particular attention is paid to the conditions if/when the bubble jet is formed and when the bubble becomes multiply connected, often forming a toroidal bubble. When subjected to a weak acoustic wave, bubble jets may develop at the two poles of the bubble surface after several cycles of oscillations. A resonant phenomenon occurs when the wave frequency is equal to the natural oscillation frequency of the bubble. When subjected to a strong acoustic wave, a vigorous liquid jet develops along the direction of wave propagation in only a few cycles of the acoustic wave.},

	abstract = {The dynamic interaction of a shockwave (modelled as a pressure pulse) with an initially spherically oscillating bubble is investigated. Upon the shockwave impact, the bubble deforms non-spherically and the flow field surrounding the bubble is determined with potential flow theory using the boundary-element method (BEM). The primary advantage of this method is its computational efficiency. The simulation process is repeated until the two opposite sides of the bubble surface collide with each other (i.e. the formation of a jet along the shockwave propagation direction). The collapse time of the bubble, its shape and the velocity of the jet are calculated. Moreover, the impact pressure is estimated based on water-hammer pressure theory. The Kelvin impulse, kinetic energy and bubble displacement (all at the moment of jet impact) are also determined. Overall, the simulated results compare favourably with experimental observations of lithotripter shockwave interaction with single bubbles (using laser-induced bubbles at various oscillation stages). The simulations confirm the experimental observation that the most intense collapse, with the highest jet velocity and impact pressure, occurs for bubbles with intermediate size during the contraction phase when the collapse time of the bubble is approximately equal to the compressive pulse duration of the shock wave. Under this condition, the maximum amount of energy of the incident shockwave is transferred to the collapsing bubble. Further, the effect of the bubble contents (ideal gas with different initial pressures) and the initial conditions of the bubble (initially oscillating vs. non-oscillating) on the dynamics of the shockwave–bubble interaction are discussed.},

This free-surface motion following the burst is modelled numerically using a boundary integral method. Jet formation and liquid entrainment rates from jet breakup into drops are calculated and compared with existing experimental evidence. In order to investigate viscous effects, a boundary layer is included in the calculations by employing a time-stepping technique which allows the boundary mesh to remain orthogonal to the surface. This allows an approximation of the vorticity development in the region of boundary-layer separation during jet formation. Calculated values of pressure and energy dissipation rates in the fluid indicate a violent motion, particularly for smaller bubbles. This has important implications for the biological industry where animal cells in bioreactors have been found to be killed by the presence of small bubbles.},

The bubbles are generated experimentally with a focused laser pulse and are compared to simulations. The gap height H and the distance of the position of bubble nucleation h with respect to the nearest wall are varied. The bubble dynamics is recorded at 500 000 frames per second and is compared to simulation results from the compressible volume of ﬂuid solver based on OpenFOAM that takes into account viscosity and surface tension. Good agreement of the spatio-temporal bubble dynamics between experiments and simulations is obtained. The ﬁndings are that the parameter space consists of three regions with distinct jetting dynamics that are characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the normalized gap height, η = H/Rmax, where Rmax is the spherical equivalent radius of the bubble at maximum expansion, and the normalized stand-off distance of the bubble measured from the centre of the gap, ζ = (H/2 − h)/Rmax. The three qualitatively distinct jetting behaviours are the transferred jet impacting on the distant wall, the double jet as a result of a bubble splitting and impacting on both walls and the directed jet from a conically shaped bubble impacting on the closest wall. The impact velocity of the liquid jets onto the walls can reach more than 200 m s−1 and strongly depends on the gap height and bubble position. The simulations reveal that the viscous boundary layers affect the bubble splitting and therefore the directions of jetting. Additionally, we found that with increasing length of the thin gap L the bubble oscillation period increases and converges for sufﬁciently large gaps.},

	abstract = {Liquid jetting and fragmentation are important in many industrial and medical applications. Here, we study the jetting from the surface of single liquid droplets undergoing internal volume oscillations. This is accomplished by an explosively expanding and collapsing vapour bubble within the droplet. We observe jets emerging from the droplet surface, which pinch off into ﬁner secondary droplets. The jetting is excited by the spherical Rayleigh–Taylor instability where the radial acceleration is due to the oscillation of an internal bubble. We study this jetting and the effect of ﬂuid viscosity experimentally and numerically. Experiments are carried out by levitating the droplet in an acoustic trap and generating a laser-induced cavitation bubble near the centre of the droplet. On the simulation side, the volume of ﬂuid method (OpenFOAM) solves the compressible Navier–Stokes equations while accounting for surface tension and viscosity. Both two-dimensional (2-D) axisymmetric and 3-D simulations are performed and show good agreement with each other and the experimental observation. While the axisymmetric simulation reveals how the bubble dynamics results destabilizes the interface, only the 3-D simulation computes the geometrically correct slender jets. Overall, experiments and simulations show good agreement for the bubble dynamics, the onset of disturbances and the rapid ejection of ﬁlaments after bubble collapse. Additionally, an analytic model for the droplet surface perturbation growth is developed based on the spherical Rayleigh–Taylor instability analysis, which allows us to evaluate the surface stability over a large parameter space. The analytic model predicts correctly the onset of jetting as a function of Reynolds number and normalized internal bubble energy.},

	abstract = {A cavitation bubble expanding and collapsing near a rigid boundary develops a directed jet ﬂow towards the boundary. In the case of a perforated plate, some of the jet ﬂow passes through the plate and thus the bubble acts as a pump transporting liquid from one side of the plate to the opposite side. The transport is rather complex, is time dependent and varies with the geometric parameters of the bubble and the connecting channel. Therefore, we ﬁrst model the transport of liquid through a perforated rigid plate for a large range of parameters and then compare some regimes with experiments using single laser-induced bubbles. The simulations are based on a Volume-of-Fluid solver in OpenFOAM and account for surface tension, compressibility and viscosity. The resulting ﬂux and generated velocity in the channel obtained in the simulations are discussed with regards to the dependence of the channel geometry, liquid viscosity and stand-off distance of the bubble to the plate. In general, high ﬂow rates are achieved for long cylindrical channels that have a similar width as the jet produced by the collapsing bubble. At low stand-off distances combined with thick plates, an annular inﬂow creates a fast and thin jet, also called needle jet, which is approximately a magnitude faster and signiﬁcantly thinner than the usually encountered microjet. In contrast, for thin plates and small stand-off distances, liquid is pumped in the opposite direction via a reverse jet.},

	abstract = {The strong bubble interactions and bursting behaviors near a free surface are studied numerically with a compressible two-phase flow solver. The interface is captured by the volume of fluid method. We investigate the effects of the dimensionless distance between the bubble and the free surface γf (scaled by the maximum bubble radius) ranging from 0.25 to 1.5. For the nonbursting cases, the essential evolution of the toroidal bubble is well captured, including the splitting, coalescence, and recollapse. Generally, a relatively thin spike is generated at the free surface during the first cycle of the bubble. Subsequently, a wider secondary spike at the base of the first spike is formed during the second bubble cycle, which leads to the formation of the crown-shaped spike. When γf is sufficiently small, the bubble bursts at the free surface and an opening cavity is generated. The pressure inside the cavity and the atmospheric pressure are not balanced immediately, and the pressure difference lasts for a while, causing the inward gas flow and the final closure of the cavity. The gas flow is found to play a vital role in the bubble bursting behaviors, which has not been well understood. By comparing with previous studies, three distinct bursting patterns are identified and discussed.},

The simulations predict accurately the overall bubble dynamics and the time-dependent liquid film thickness between the bubble and the wall prior to the collapse. The spatial and temporal wall shear stress is discussed in detail as a function of γ and the inverse Reynolds number 1/Re. The amplitude of the wall shear stress is investigated over a large parameter space of viscosity and stand-off distance.

Jets and drops emerge following the nucleation of a cavitation bubble in the liquid bulk by a laser-induced plasma. During the initial expansion of the bubble, a thin and fast jet is produced at the liquid surface. Moments later a second thick and slow jet emanates from the surface when the bubble has nearly deflated. Despite potential applications, little is known about the mechanism behind this complex phenomenology. Here, experiments and simulations are used to investigate this two-jet process. Counter-intuitively, the second jet is not the result of bubble expansion, as with the first jet, but originates from the secondary flows induced by the bubble dynamics. Our study links the second jet properties to the control parameters of the problem and establishes a phase diagram for its emergence.},

Special features such as “breaking wrinkles,” “spraying water film,” and other unstable phenomena were observed with free surface motions, which were hardly captured by a boundary integral scheme. Parameters defining the shape of the free surface, such as the spike height Hspike, the spike width Wbase, and the skirt height Hspray, are measured and analyzed against γf.

For a set of specified conditions, multiple beaded water masses were formed, moving upwards to produce a vigorous jet. Cavitation phenomena occurred near the center of the primary drop-shaped water mass produced at the leading part of the jet; this was accompanied by fine droplets at the neck between the primary and secondary drop-shaped water masses, due to the collapse of capillary waves.},

A thin jet is shown to deform a crater surface resulted from surface depression and cause a circular ring-shaped crater on the connection surface between the crater of surface depression and the thin jet. The collapse of this circular ring-shaped crater is proposed to the crown-like formation around a thick jet. The evolution of the bubble depth suggests a classification of four distinctive ranges of the bubble depths: non-crown formation when the parameter of bubble depth over the maximum bubble radius γ ≤ 0.5, unstable crown formation when 0.5 ≤ γ ≤ 0.6, crown-like structure with a complete crown wall when 0.6 ≤ γ ≤ 1.1, and non-crown formation when 1.1 ≤ γ. Furthermore, the orientation of the crown wall gradually turns counterclockwise to vertical direction with increasing γ from 0.5 to 1.1, implying a high correlation between the orientation of the crown wall and the depth of the bubble. This correlation is explained and discussed by the directional change of the jet eruption from the collapse of circular ring-shaped crater.},

We show that the pool rotation advances the transition of the cavity type – from deep seal to surface seal – marked by a reduction in the transitional Froude number. The role of the dimensionless rotational number S ≡ωR₀/U₀ on the transient cavity dynamics is unveiled, where R₀ is the sphere radius, ω the angular speed of the liquid and U₀ the impact velocity. The rotating background liquid has two discernible effects on the cavity evolution. Firstly, an increase in the underwater pressure field due to centripetal effects; and secondly, a reduction in the pressure of airflow in the cavity neck near the water surface. The non-dimensional pinch-off time of the deep seal shows a robust 1/2 power-law dependence on the Froude number, but with a reducing prefactor for increasing ω. Our findings reveal that the effects of a rotating background liquid on the water entry can be traced back to the subtle differences in the initial stage splash and the near-surface cavity dynamics.},

While the formation mechanism of the central jet is known and documented, that of the crown remains unsettled. We perform axisymmetric simulations of the problem using the free software program BASILISK, where a finite-volume compressible solver has been implemented, which uses a geometric volume-of-fluid (VoF) method for the tracking of the interface. We show that the mechanism of crown formation is a combination of a pressure distortion over the curved interface, inducing flow focusing, and of a flow reversal, caused by the second expansion of the toroidal bubble that drives the crown. The work culminates in a parametric study with the Weber number, the Reynolds number, the pressure ratio and the dimensionless bubble distance to the free surface as control parameters. Their effects on both the central jet and the crown are explored. For high Weber numbers, we observe the formation of weaker ‘secondary crowns’, highly correlated with the third oscillation cycle of the bubble.},

However, in case of a long gap, the ink is scattered; therefore, good printing quality could not be obtained. We succeeded in printing high-quality droplets even for long flight distances of 500 μm or more. The laser beam was shaped by the beam size and wavefront converters and then transformed into an annular beam. The experiment was conducted when the gap between the donor and receiver substrates was in the range of 200–2000 μm. The landing droplet was microscopically observed to form an almost perfect circle.

In this paper, the material ejection from copper films induced by nanosecond laser pulses was studied. Two reversely oriented ejections were induced simultaneously by a single laser shot. The opposite ejected droplets were significantly smaller than the direct ejected ones, and were separated from the remnant donor material clearly, which might be utilized to fabricate microstructures on the donor substrates. Three distinct ejection regimes: no ejection, stable ejection and sputtering were characterized with respect to the laser intensity. The thermal field and the phase transition within the donor film were analyzed with a finite element model. Correlations between the phase transitions and the ejection regimes were noticed, suggesting that the material ejection was mainly caused by the cavitation effect. The dynamics of the laser-induced cavitation bump and the formation of the jets were simulated with a vapor–liquid lattice Boltzmann model. The formation of the bump and the material ejections were clearly demonstrated. It was concluded that the jets were mainly induced by the collision of the cumulating flows, which were generated within the bump shell by the asymmetrical cavitation of the bump. The dynamics of the vapor also plays an important role in the development of the jets. The simulation results agree well with the present experimental observations.},

	abstract = {In this study, a nondestructive ring-shaped laser ultrasonic method with a thermoelastic excitation regime was used to determine the grain size of metal materials. This method was proposed in order to evaluate the quality of metal in a fast online nondestructive manner. Normally, laser ultrasonic is used to detect grain size in the ablation excitation regime. The laser excites high energy longitudinal waves but causes damage to the surface of metal materials. To achieve strict online nondestructive testing, the thermoelastic regime was used in this work. The ring-shaped laser was converted from a circular collimated laser by an axicon and irradiated on the surface of the aluminum sample to induce ultrasonic waves and enhance the signal amplitude. The directivity pattern was analyzed to find a suitable detection parameter by the finite element method before performing laser ultrasound experiments. Quantitative analysis of the converging waves with different deviations from the center via laser ultrasound experiments demonstrated the enhancement effect of signal energy using a ring-shaped laser. The issues of low signal energy and the generation of a directivity pattern were solved by this ring-shaped laser ultrasonic method aimed at nondestructive grain size inspection. Aluminum samples with different mean grain sizes were detected by ring-shaped laser ultrasonic technology. A grain size characterization model was built with mean grain sizes and ultrasonic signals. Laser-generated ultrasound technology in the thermoelastic regime is a promising online detection method and can be used to detect material properties nondestructively with a ring-shaped laser.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this work we propose and demonstrate a Fresnel-lens-inspired method to focus multiple laser-induced shock waves through time-delay superposition at arbitrary locations. While the principle works for any geometry, we demonstrate that this method already achieves focusing with two pairs of photoacoustic shock wave emitters located on a line centred around the acoustic axis (z) in a quasi-two-dimensional liquid geometry. Each emitter pair is created by focusing one laser pulse simultaneously at two spots with a spatial light modulator at z=0 𝜇m with y=±145 𝜇m and y=±75 𝜇m. The delays between the emitters necessary to vary the location of the focus from z≈0 to ∼206 𝜇m are 35 and 0 ns, respectively. We find that the location of constructive superposition is significantly closer to the origin than what would be expected for linear waves in homogeneous media. This is confirmed with simulations using an Euler solver that shows the importance of finite-amplitude effects. The simulated dynamics are in reasonable agreement with our measurements. Finally, pressure gains at various locations along the acoustic axis are tested with the response of gaseous microbubbles acting as pressure probes. The measurements agree with calculated pressure ratios at different positions.},

	abstract = {Inkjet printing (IJP) is the most widespread direct‐write technique in paper electronics. However, this technique cannot be used for printing devices on untreated regular paper, since its low‐viscosity nanoinks leak through the cellulose fibers. Thus, a planarization coating is frequently used as a barrier, even though this makes substrates more expensive and less eco‐friendly. Alternatively, high solid content screen printing (SP) inks could allow printing on regular paper due to their high viscosity and large particle size; however, they cannot be printed through IJP. Another digital technique is then required: laser‐induced forward transfer (LIFT). This work aims at proving the feasibility of LIFT for printing devices on regular paper. The main transfer parameters are systematically varied to obtain uniform Ag‐SP interconnects, whose performance is improved by a multiple‐printing approach. It results in low resistances with much better performance than those typical of IJP. After optimizing the functionality of the printed lines, a proof‐of‐concept consisting of a radio‐frequency inductor is provided. The characterization of the device shows a substantially higher performance than that of the same device printed with IJP ink in similar conditions, which proves the potential of LIFT for digitally fabricating devices on regular paper.},

	abstract = {Focused jets have been widely studied owing to the abundance of attractive flow phenomena and industrial applications, whereas annular focused jets are less studied. This study combines experiments, numerical simulations, and analytical modeling to investigate the effect of the contact angle on the generation position and focusing efficiency of annular focused jets between parallel plates. In the experiment, a pulsed laser generates a cavitation bubble inside the droplet, and the rapidly expanding cavitation bubble drives an annular-focused jet on the droplet surface. Changing the plate wettability creates different contact angles and droplet surface shapes between the droplet and plates, which modulates the position and focusing efficiency of the annular jet. Based on the jet singularity theory and by neglecting gravity, the derived formula for the jet position offset is found to depend only on the contact angle, which is in good agreement with the experimental and numerical simulation results. Combined with numerical simulations to analyze the flow characteristics of the droplets between the parallel plates, a new calculation method for the jet focusing efficiency is proposed. Interestingly, when the liquid surface radius is small, the focusing efficiency can be improved by adjusting the contact angle to make the jet position closer to the flat plate, whereas the same operation reduces the focusing efficiency when the radius is large. The study of annular jets can expand the scope of traditional jet research and has the potential to provide new approaches for applications, such as high-throughput inkjet printing and liquid transfer.},

In these applications, the bubbles undergo oscillatory dynamics and collapse inside—or near—soft and biological materials.

Surfactant molecules or solid particles adsorbed on a bubble surface can also modify the bubble dynamics through the rheological properties of the interfacial layer. Furthermore, the interaction of bubbles with biological cells and tissues is highly dependent on the mechanical properties of these soft deformable media. This review covers recent developments in bubble dynamics in soft and biological matter for different conﬁnement conditions: bubbles in a viscoelastic medium, coated by a viscoelastic layer, or in the vicinity of soft conﬁnement or objects.

In particular, the effect of the interaction of multiple bubbles on bubble-collapse behaviour and impulsive pressure induced by bubble collapse should also be discussed. In this study, a compressible locally homogeneous model of a gas–liquid two-phase medium is used to numerically analyse the multiple-bubble behaviour in a megasonic ﬁeld. The numerical results indicate that, for bubbles with the same equilibrium radius, the natural frequency of the bubble decreases, and bubbles with smaller equilibrium radii resonate with the megasonic wave as the number of bubbles increases. Therefore, the equilibrium radius of bubbles showing maximum wall pressure decreases with an increasing number of bubbles. The increase in bubble number also results in chain collapse, inducing high wall pressure. The effect of the conﬁguration of bubbles is discussed, and the bubble–bubble interaction in the concentric distribution makes a greater contribution to the decrease in the natural frequency of bubbles than the interaction in the straight distribution.},

While the force has been investigated extensively for two-bubble systems, the modulation of the force by nearby bubbles remains unclear. This problem is investigated in this paper by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of a three bubble system. For weak oscillations, the third bubble is found to have strong effects when its radius is close to the resonant radius. The equilibrium distance between the bubble pair is reduced when the radius of the third bubble is smaller than the resonant threshold, and increased when it is larger. For strong oscillations of bubbles with radii of a few microns, the third bubble reduces the magnitude of the force, hence increasing the equilibrium distance. The modulation effects depend strongly on the relative sizes of the bubbles. Stronger effects can be produced when the third bubble is placed closer to the smaller bubble in the bubble pair. The findings highlight the need for a more accurate parametrization of the secondary Bjerknes force in the simulation and manipulation of bubble clusters.},

	abstract = {Underwater pulse detonation gas jets generated by a detonation tube are experimentally investigated in this study utilizing detonations in explosive gas mixtures to generate pulsating bubbles under water. Three stoichiometric gaseous fuels (methane, hydrogen, and acetylene) are detonated with oxygen under the same filling conditions. Digital particle image velocimetry and wavelet transform techniques are introduced to analyze bubble dynamics and pressure field characteristics by means of which the velocity field of the bubble interface and the time–frequency distributions of the pressure response under water are elucidated, respectively. Motions of the bubble interface, which can now be clearly seen with the oscillations, are indicated in high-speed photographic images. Three main frequency components and their duration are identified: reverberations of water tank, pulsations of the detonation gas bubble, and fluctuations of free water surface. Experimental results show that the reverberation concentrating in high frequencies is due to the detonation wave (DW) and reflected shock waves in the water tank; the pulsations are related to the bubble oscillating periods, which are stronger as the detonation pressure increases; and fluctuation occurs in both the bubble oscillating and floating stages. To explain the directional growth of the detonation gas bubble, an experiment of pulse detonation gas jet in air is conducted where the sudden release of detonation products behind the DW and the subsequent impulsive detonation gas jet are qualitatively presented. Results presented in this paper give in-depth analysis of pulse detonation gas jets and provide a new way to generate pulsating bubbles under water.},

We derive the equations for arbitrary configurations of two-dimensional bubbles.

The strength and direction of the emerging liquid jets can be controlled by adjusting the relative bubble positions, the time difference between bubble generation, and the laser pulse energies determining the bubble sizes. Experimental and numerical studies are performed for millimetre-sized bubble pairs. Taking bubbles of equal energy, a maximum jet velocity is found for close anti-phase bubbles, i.e. when the second bubble is produced at the maximum volume of the ﬁrst one and the bubble walls are almost touching and not merging. Under these conditions, one bubble produces a fast jet with a peak velocity of about 150 m s−1 that reaches a distance into the surrounding liquid of at least three times the maximum bubble radius. Collapse of the other bubble results in a slow jet of large mass that rapidly converts into a ring vortex. Correspondingly, the interaction with adjacent structures is dominated either by localized jet impact or by shear stresses extending over a larger area. Furthermore, interactions between micrometre-sized bubble pairs are investigated numerically to understand and predict how the effects of the physical parameters on bubble dynamics would change when the bubbles become smaller. The results are discussed with respect to micropumping and opto-injection.},

Three synchronized laser beams split from the same beam using a Diffractive Optical Element splitter were focused on water, and then we obtained three bubbles. Another nanosecond laser pulse was used to probe the bubbles to obtain shadowgraphs. The exact delay of the excited and detected light was controlled using a delay generator. The results revealed that the maximum volumes of bubbles in arrays decrease as the normalized distance falls, while the lifetimes and translation increase. It was explained by the interaction between the acoustic radiation of bubbles and the surrounding bubbles. The shrinkage of linear bubble arrays exists an anomaly. The center bubbles were stretched, to ellipsoid, stick, even fractured, by the peripheral bubbles. The closer they are, the more distinct is the above phenomenon. However, when the normalized dis­ tance was sufficiently small, instead of being stretched, the center bubbles were compressed to disk shape and thus shrank with the whole array. Finally, the dependence of the distance on the energy transfer of the bubble system is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Micro-bubbles and bubbly flows are widely observed and applied in chemical engineering, medicine, involves deformation, rupture, and collision of bubbles, phase mixture, etc. We study bubble dynamics by setting up two numerical simulation cases: bubbly flow with a single bubble and multiple bubbles, both confined in the microchannel, with parameters corresponding to their medical backgrounds. Both the cases have their medical background applications. Multiphase flow simulation requires high computation accuracy due to possible component losses that may be caused by sparse meshing during the computation. Hence, data-driven methods can be adopted as an useful tool. Based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we propose a novel deep learning framework BubbleNet, which entails three main parts: deep neural networks (DNN) with sub nets for predicting different physics fields; the semi-physics-informed part, with only the fluid continuum condition and the pressure Poisson equation \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{P\}\$ encoded within; the time discretized normalizer (TDN), an algorithm to normalize field data per time step before training. We apply the traditional DNN and our BubbleNet to train the coarsened simulation data and predict the physics fields of both the two bubbly flow cases. The BubbleNets are trained for both with and without \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{P\}\$, from which we conclude that the 'physics-informed' part can serve as inner supervision. Results indicate our framework can predict the physics fields more accurately, estimating the prediction absolute errors. Our deep learning predictions outperform traditional numerical methods computed with similar data density meshing. The proposed network can potentially be applied to many other engineering fields.},

For multiphase flows, it would require significant computational resources for neural network training due to the large gradients near the interface between the two fluids. Based on the idea of the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a modified deep learning framework BubbleNet is proposed to overcome this difficulty in the present study. The deep neural network (DNN) with separate sub-nets is adopted to predict physics fields, with the semi-physics-informed part encoding the continuity equation and the pressure Poisson equation [Formula: see text] for supervision and the time discretized normalizer to normalize field data per time step before training. Two bubbly flows, i.e., single bubble flow and multiple bubble flow in a microchannel, are considered to test the algorithm. The conventional computational fluid dynamics software is applied to obtain the training dataset. The traditional DNN and the BubbleNet(s) are utilized to train the neural network and predict the flow fields for the two bubbly flows. Results indicate the BubbleNet frameworks are able to successfully predict the physics fields, and the inclusion of the continuity equation significantly improves the performance of deep NNs. The introduction of the Poisson equation also has slightly positive effects on the prediction results. The results suggest that constructing semi-PINNs by flexibly considering the physical information into neural networks will be helpful in the learning of complex flow problems.},

	abstract = {High-pressure bubble dynamics often involves many complex issues, including large deformations and inhomogeneities, strong compression, moving interfaces, and large discontinuities, that bring challenges to numerical simulations. In this work, an axisymmetric Riemann–smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used to simulate high-pressure bubbles near different boundaries. This Riemann–SPH can adopt the real sound speed instead of the artificial one for the air phase in the bubble. Therefore, the real compressibility of the air phase can be considered, and the corresponding time step is significantly increased. To avoid unphysical interface penetration and maintain relatively homogeneous particle distribution, a new and simple particle shifting scheme for multiphase flows is proposed. Additionally, to minimize the influence of the unphysical boundary on the bubble, a large fluid domain with an optimized initial particle distribution is adopted to reduce the particle number. Several high-pressure bubbles under different boundary conditions are considered, including in a free field, near a free surface, near a solid boundary, and near a rigid sphere. Numerical results show that these bubble dynamic behaviors can be reproduced with satisfactory accuracy.},

	abstract = {The response of underwater structures to a near-field explosion is coupled with the dynamics of the explosion bubble and the surrounding water. This multiphase fluid–structure interaction process is investigated in the paper using a two-dimensional model problem that features the yielding and collapse of a thin-walled aluminum cylinder. A recently developed computational framework that couples a finite volume compressible fluid dynamics solver with a finite element structural dynamics solver is employed. The fluid–structure and liquid–gas interfaces are tracked using embedded boundary and level set methods. The conservation of mass and momentum across the interfaces is enforced by solving one-dimensional bimaterial Riemann problems. The initial pressure inside the explosion bubble is varied by two orders of magnitude in different test cases. Three different modes of collapse are discovered, including an horizontal collapse (i.e. with one lobe extending towards the explosive charge) that appears counterintuitive, yet has been observed in previous laboratory experiments. Because of the transition of modes, the time it takes for the structure to reach self-contact does not decrease monotonically as the explosion magnitude increases. The fluid pressure and velocity fields, the bubble dynamics, and the transient structural deformation are visualized to elucidate the cause of each collapse mode and the mode transitions. The result suggests that, in addition to the incident shock wave, the second pressure pulse resulting from the contraction of the explosion bubble also has significant effect on the structure’s collapse. The phase difference between the structural vibration and the bubble’s expansion and contraction influences the structure’s mode of collapse. Furthermore, the transient structural deformation has clear effect on the bubble dynamics, leading to a two-way interaction. A counter-jet that points away from the structural surface is observed. Compared to the liquid jets produced by bubbles collapsing near a rigid wall, this counter-jet is in the opposite direction.},

	abstract = {The generation of colloidal solutions of chemically clean nanoparticles through pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) has evolved into a thriving research field that impacts industrial applications. The complexity and multiscale nature of PLAL make it difficult to untangle the various processes involved in the generation of nanoparticles and establish the dependence of nanoparticle yield and size distribution on the irradiation parameters. Large-scale atomistic simulations have yielded important insights into the fundamental mechanisms of ultrashort (femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds) PLAL and provided a plausible explanation of the origin of the experimentally observed bimodal nanoparticle size distributions. In this paper, we extend the atomistic simulations to short (hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds) laser pulses and focus our attention on the effect of the pulse duration on the mechanisms responsible for the generation of nanoparticles at the initial dynamic stage of laser ablation. Three distinct nanoparticle generation mechanisms operating at different stages of the ablation process and in different parts of the emerging cavitation bubble are identified in the simulations. These mechanisms are (1) the formation of a thin transient metal layer at the interface between the ablation plume and water environment followed by its decomposition into large molten nanoparticles, (2) the nucleation, growth, and rapid cooling/solidification of small nanoparticles at the very front of the emerging cavitation bubble, above the transient interfacial metal layer, and (3) the spinodal decomposition of a part of the ablation plume located below the transient interfacial layer, leading to the formation of a large population of nanoparticles growing in a high-temperature environment through inter-particle collisions and coalescence. The coexistence of the three distinct mechanisms of the nanoparticle formation at the initial stage of the ablation process can be related to the broad nanoparticle size distributions commonly observed in nanosecond PLAL experiments. The strong dependence of the nanoparticle cooling and solidification rates on the location within the low-density metal-water mixing region has important implications for the long-term evolution of the nanoparticle size distribution, as well as for the ability to quench the nanoparticle growth or dope them by adding surface-active agents or doping elements to the liquid environment.},

Single bubbles kept in a bubble trap and single laser-generated bubbles are investigated using ultrafast and high-speed photography in combination with hydrophones. The optical observation at 20 million frames per second of the shock waves emitted has proven instrumental in revealing the dynamic process upon bubble collapse. When jet formation is initiated by a non-spherically symmetric environment, several distinct shock waves are emitted within a few hundred nanoseconds, originating from diﬀerent sites of the bubble. The counterjet phenomenon is interpreted in this context as a secondary cavitation event. Furthermore, the light emission of laser-generated cavities—termed cavitation bubble luminescence—is studied with respect to the symmetry of collapse. The prospects of optical cavitation and multibubble trapping in the study of few-bubble systems and bubble interactions are brieﬂy discussed. Finally, the behaviour of bubble clouds, their oscillations, acoustic noise and light emission are described. Depending on the strength of the driving sound ﬁeld, period doubling and chaotic oscillations of the collective bubble dynamics are observed.},

	abstract = {Fast liquid jets, called micro-jets, are produced within cavitation bubbles experiencing an aspherical collapse. Here we review micro-jets of different origins, scales and appearances, and propose a uniﬁed framework to describe their dynamics by using an anisotropy parameter ζ 0, representing a dimensionless measure of the liquid momentum at the collapse point (Kelvin impulse). This parameter is rigorously deﬁned for various jet drivers, including gravity and nearby boundaries. Combining theoretical considerations with hundreds of high-speed visualisations of bubbles collapsing near a rigid surface, near a free surface or in variable gravity, we classify the jets into three distinct regimes: weak, intermediate and strong. Weak jets (ζ {\textless} 10−3) hardly pierce the bubble, but remain within it throughout the collapse and rebound. Intermediate jets (10−3 {\textless} ζ {\textless} 0.1) pierce the opposite bubble wall close to the last collapse phase and clearly emerge during the rebound. Strong jets (ζ {\textgreater} 0.1) pierce the bubble early during the collapse. The dynamics of the jets is analysed through key observables, such as the jet impact time, jet speed, bubble displacement, bubble volume at jet impact and vapour-jet volume. We ﬁnd that, upon normalising these observables to dimensionless jet parameters, they all reduce to straightforward functions of ζ , which we can reproduce numerically using potential ﬂow theory. An interesting consequence of this result is that a measurement of a single observable, such as the bubble displacement, sufﬁces to estimate any other parameter, such as the jet speed. Remarkably, the dimensionless parameters of intermediate and weak jets (ζ {\textless} 0.1) depend only on ζ , not on the jet driver (i.e. gravity or boundaries).

	abstract = {Multiple breakdowns in liquids still remains obscure for its complex, nonequilibrium and transient dynamic process. We introduced three methods, namely, plasma imaging, light-scattering technique, and acoustic detection, to measure the multiple breakdown in water induced by focused nanosecond laser pulses simultaneously. Our results showed that linear dependence existed among the cavitation-bubble lifetime, the far-field peak pressure of the initial shock wave, and the corresponding plasma volume. Such a relationship can be used to evaluate the ideal size and energy of each bubble during multiple breakdown. The major bubble lifetime was hardly affected by the inevitable coalescence of cavitation bubbles, thereby confirming the availability of light-scattering technique on the estimation of bubble size during multiple breakdown. Whereas, the strength of collapseshock-wave and the subsequent rebound of bubbles was strongly influenced, i.e., the occurrence of multiple breakdown suppressed the cavitation-bubble energy being converted into collapse-shock-wave energy but enhanced conversion into rebound-bubble energy. This study is a valuable contribution to research on the rapid mixing of microfluidics, damage control of microsurgery, and photoacoustic applications.},

However, this paper focuses on how a fundamental concept, the Kelvin impulse, can provide practical insights into engineering and industrial design problems. The pathway is provided through physical insight, idealized experiments and enhancing the accuracy and interpretation of the computation. In 1966, Benjamin and Ellis made a number of important statements relating to the use of the Kelvin impulse in cavitation and bubble dynamics, one of these being ‘One should always reason in terms of the Kelvin impulse, not in terms of the fluid momentum…’. We revisit part of this paper, developing the Kelvin impulse from first principles, using it, not only as a check on advanced computations (for which it was first used!), but also to provide greater physical insights into cavitation bubble dynamics near boundaries (rigid, potential free surface, two-fluid interface, flexible surface and axisymmetric stagnation point flow) and to provide predictions on different types of bubble collapse behaviour, later compared against experiments. The paper concludes with two recent studies involving (i) the direction of the jet formation in a cavitation bubble close to a rigid boundary in the presence of high-intensity ultrasound propagated parallel to the surface and (ii) the study of a ‘paradigm bubble model’ for the collapse of a translating spherical bubble, sometimes leading to a constant velocity high-speed jet, known as the Longuet-Higgins jet.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of continuous-wave laser irradiation on the cavity evolution behind a sphere in water entry. By tuning the irradiation time, the surface temperature (Ts) of the sphere before the impact varies in 105–355 ○C. We change the radius and impact velocity of the sphere, by which both the shallow and deep seals are considered. Compared to the reference case (the sphere was roughened to have a cavity initially), we find that the cavity expands or shrinks depending on Ts. Overall, for all cases, the cavity bubble expands to the maximum size and shrinks steeply with increasing Ts. At higher Ts, the cavity is destroyed significantly, even smaller than the reference case. However, the detailed interaction between the cavity and laser-induced cavitation bubbles is quite different. In a shallow-seal case, nucleate boiling occurs on the sphere surface and vapor bubbles merge into the cavity, resulting in the expansion of the cavity. At a highly subcooled condition, on the other hand, the vapor bubble collapses into microbubbles as soon as it contacts water, resulting in the cavity reduction. As the impact speed increases (for a deep-seal condition), the flux of entrained air becomes dominant and the stage of cavity expansion is quite narrow. As Ts increases, the heated cavity collapses into microbubbles and almost 90\% is destroyed. Finally, we investigate the effects of modified cavity on hydrodynamic forces on the sphere. While the temporal variation of hydrodynamic forces is complex, the drag reduction over 40\% is achieved.},

We have investigated the transient properties of Nd:YAG laser induced breakdown in a saline model using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Spatially resolved pump and probe techniques are applied to study the dynamic behavior of the plasma formation, acoustic wave generation, and cavitation processes which accompany the optical breakdown. Measurements of plasma shielding and luminescence indicate that the laser induced plasma forms on a subnanosecond time scale and has a lifetime of several nanoseconds. An acoustic transient is generated at the breakdown site and propagates spherically outward with an initial hypersonic velocity, then loses energy and propagates at sound velocity. Transient heating following the plasma formation produces a liquid-gas phase change and gives rise to cavitation or gas bubble formation. This gas bubble expands rapidly for several microseconds, then slows to reach its maximum size and finally collapses.},

In this work, we investigate the spectral features of ionic, atomic and molecular emissions for the plasma in water at different pressures from 1 to 40 MPa. By comparing between the time-resolved spectra and shadowgraph images, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the cavitation bubble at high pressures plays a key role on the characterization of plasma emission. The initial plasma emission depends weakly on the external pressure. As time evolves, the cavitation bubble is more compressed by the higher external pressure, leading to a positive confinement effect to maintain the plasma emission. However, at very high pressures, the bubble collapses extremely fast and even earlier than the cooling of the plasma. The plasma will gain energy from the bubble collapse phase, but quench immediately after the collapse, leading to a sharp reduction in the plasma persistence. These effects caused by bubble dynamics explain well the observed spectral features and are further proved by the temporal evolutions of the plasma temperature and electron density. This work gives not only some insights into the laser-induced plasma and bubble dynamics in high pressure liquids but also better understanding for the application of underwater LIBS in the deep-sea.},

	abstract = {Laser induced cavitation is one of the effective techniques to generate controlled cavitation bubbles, both for basic study and for applications in different fields of engineering and medicine. Unfortunately, control of bubble formation and symmetry is hardly achieved due to a series of concurrent causes. In particular, the need to focus the laser beam at the bubble formation spot leads, in general, to a conical region proximal to the light source where conditions are met for plasma breakdown. A finite sized region then exists where the electric field may fluctuate depending on several disturbing agents, leading to possible plasma fragmentation and plasma intensity variation. Such irregularities may induce asymmetry in the successive bubble dynamics, a mostly undesired effect if reproducible conditions are sought for. In the present paper, the structure of the breakdown plasma and the ensuing bubble dynamics are analyzed by means of high speed imaging and intensity measurements of the shockwave system launched at breakdown. It is found that the parameters of the system can be tuned to optimize repeatability and sphericity. In particular, symmetric rebound dynamics is achieved almost deterministically when a pointlike plasma is generated at the breakdown threshold energy. Spherical symmetry is also favored by a large focusing angle combined with a relatively large pulse energy, a process which, however, retains a significant level of stochasticity. Outside these special conditions, the elongated and often fragmented conical plasma shape is found to be correlated with anisotropic and multiple breakdown shockwave emission.},

	abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of stand-off laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (ST-LIBS) for the analysis of distant submerged objects. The applicability of underwater stand-off LIBS is highly challenging since it involves the delivery of a focused laser pulse toward the distant target through the aqueous media and then the transmission of the light emitted by the laser-induced plasma back to the detection system. Experiments were designed to gain fundamental knowledge regarding LIBS analysis in an underwater open-path configuration. Samples were analyzed at distances up to 80 cm from the sensor at a solid–water interface. Effective plasma formation was achieved using dual pulse excitation with Nd:YAG laser pulses at 532 nm. Intense and well resolved emission signals were observed with interpulse delay times close to 500 μs, whereas the lifetime of the laser-induced plasma was only a few μs. The effect of water temperature and the influence of the underwater optical path on the LIBS signal have also been evaluated.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the formation of low- and high-density plasmas in aqueous media using sub-nanosecond laser pulses delivered at low numerical aperture (NA = 0.25). We observe two distinct regimes of plasma formation in deionized water, phosphate buffered saline, Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), and MEM supplemented with phenol red. Optical breakdown is first initiated in a low-energy regime and characterized by bubble formation without plasma luminescence with threshold pulse energies in the range of Ep ≈ 4-5 μJ, depending on media formulation. The onset of this regime occurs over a very narrow interval of pulse energies and produces small bubbles (Rmax = 2-20 μm) due to a tiny conversion (η ¡ 0.01\%) of laser energy to bubble energy EB. The lack of visible plasma luminescence, sharp energy onset, and low bubble energy conversion are all hallmarks of low-density plasma (LDP) formation. At higher pulse energies (Ep = 11-20 μJ), the process transitions to a second regime characterized by plasma luminescence and large bubble formation. Bubbles formed in this regime are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger in size [Formula: see text] due to a roughly two-order-of-magnitude increase in bubble energy conversion (η ≳ 3\%). These characteristics are consistent with high-density plasma formation produced by avalanche ionization and thermal runaway. Additionally, we show that supplementation of MEM with fetal bovine serum (FBS) limits optical breakdown to this high-energy regime. The ability to produce LDPs using sub-nanosecond pulses focused at low NA in a variety of cell culture media formulations without FBS can provide for cellular manipulation at high throughput with precision approaching that of femtosecond pulses delivered at high NA.},

	abstract = {The influence of spherical aberrations on laser-induced plasma formation in water by 6-ns Nd:YAG laser pulses of 1064 nm wavelength was investigated. Experiments and numerical calculations were carried out for focusing angles similar to those used for intraocular microsurgery. Wave form distortions of 5.5 lambda and 18.5 lambda between the optical axis and the 1/e2 irradiance values of the laser beam were introduced by replacing laser achromats in the delivery system by plano- convex lenses. Aberrations of 18.5 lambda led to an increase of the energy threshold by a factor of 8.5. The threshold irradiance calculated using the diffraction limited spot size was 10 times increased as compared to the case of minimized aberrations and 48 times larger than the actual threshold. The threshold calculated with the measured focus diameter was, on the other hand, reduced by a factor of 35. This reduction is due to the presence of hot spots in the focal region of the aberrated laser beam. In these hot spots, the threshold irradiance is probably unchanged, but the threshold value is reduced when averaged over the whole measured diameter of the beam waist. The determination of breakdown threshold in the presence of aberrations leads, hence, to strongly erroneous results. In the presence of aberrations, the plasmas are up to 3 times longer and the transmitted energy is 17 - 20 times larger than without aberrations. Aberrations can thus strongly compromise the precision and safety of intraocular microsurgery where they may arise through the use of inappropriate contact lenses, tilting of the lens, and oblique light passage through the ocular media. They can further account for a major part of the differences in breakdown threshold and plasma transmission values reported in previous investigations.},

In order to evaluate the focusing geometry effect on laser-induced plasma in bulk water, four focusing arrangements were tried out with a single lens as well as with a double-lens combination. We demonstrated that, for the same transmission distance in water, the double-lens combination with shorter effective focal length generated more condensed plasma, as shown by the spectroscopic and fast imaging results. Accordingly, the moving breakdown phenomenon significantly decreased with well-improved LIBS intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, and stability. The plasma emissions evidently attenuated along the laser transmission due to the strong absorption effect of the water medium. Based on the acquired results, the performance of a practical detection window was evaluated by combining the regular lens with a customized lens-shaped optical window, and a positive outcome was also reached. The obtained results suggested that improved LIBS detection could be easily achieved via settling another lens window to LIBS system, which is considered helpful for better in situ submarine application.},

The traditional normalization method by using the internal standard element is often limited in some practical cases due to the lack of a suitable element as a reference. In this work, we developed an effective normalization method by using the plasma image information for underwater LIBS analysis. Correlations between the plasma images and LIBS spectra were firstly studied, showing a good linear relationship between the spectral line intensity and plasma image intensity. Subsequently, the spectral line intensities were standardized by using the corresponding image intensities and then used for quantitative analysis. A good normalization model was established by using partial least squares regression (PLSR). With the proposed method, the average relative standard deviations (RSDs) of validation samples were significantly reduced from 10.71\% to 5.76\%, and the average relative errors (AREs) of the validation samples were also reduced from 7.80\% to 7.55\%. Moreover, by combining the proposed method with the internal standard method, the average RSD and ARE can be further reduced to 4.07\% and 4.86\%, respectively, both of which are better than those obtained using the internal standard method only.},

	abstract = {Long ns pulses have been proven to be effective in enhancing the LIBS signals of submerged solids. However, the enhancement effect on the liquid detection has yet to be further revealed, which is also of great significance for the application of long-pulse LIBS in underwater chemical analysis. In this work, we investigated the temporal emission characteristics of underwater laser-induced plasma under different pulse duration conditions by using time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging techniques. It is shown that short pulses lead to the formation of an elongated and short-lived plasma with weak emission due to multi-site underwater breakdown, and a rapid decrease of line intensity with delay time. Long pulses with a pulse duration of 180 ns, on the other hand, produce a compact plasma with strong emission and longer lifetime. Such an enhancement is more pronounced for the spectral line with a high-energy transition level, whose line intensity can be increased by more than 7 times. For this reason, the clear atomic lines of O in water are also detected, which are difficult to be observed with short pulses. This is also related to the changes in the physical properties of the plasma, i.e., the long pulses enable the plasma to maintain higher electron density and plasma temperature for a longer period of time. The present results suggest that long ns pulses can be of great advantage in underwater LIBS detection as well as capable of performing important roles in in-situ chemical applications.},

	abstract = {The exploitation and research of deep-sea hydrothermal vent has been an issue of great interest in ocean research in recent years. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has great potential for ocean application due to the capabilities of stand-off, multiphase, and multielement analysis. In this work, a newly developed compact 4000 m rated LIBS system (LIBSea) is introduced with preliminary results of sea trials. The underwater system consists of an Nd:YAG single-pulsed laser operating at 1064 nm, an optical fiber spectrometer, an optics module, and an electronic controller module. The whole system is housed in an L800 mm×ϕ258 mm pressure housing with an optical window on the end cap. It was deployed on the remote operated vehicle Faxian on the research vessel Kexue, and in June 2015 was successfully applied for hydrothermal field measurements at the Manus area. The obtained results are shown that the LIBS system is capable of detecting elements Li, Na, K, Ca, and Mg in the hydrothermal area. Profiles of LIBS signals of elements K and Ca have also been obtained during the sea trial. The results show that the K emission line is gradually broadened with depth from sea surface to sea floor (1800 m or so); the K intensity shows a hump shape with maximum value at about 1050 m. The Ca emission line is rapidly broadened below 400 m and slowly narrowed to the sea floor; the Ca intensity shows no obvious change below 400 m and increases continuously to sea floor. A very interesting finding is that the small fluctuations of intensity profile curve of Ca show a degree of correlation with seawater temperature change. The sea trial results prove the performance of LIBSea. After further optimization, it is hoped to apply the LIBS system to the in situ mineral deposits and hydrothermal vent fluid detection in deep sea.},

	abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been successfully applied to ocean exploration, but the changes in marine environmental factors could have an important impact on the LIBS signals. The aim of the research is to investigate the ambient water temperature effects on laser-induced plasma in bulk water. Both the spectroscopic and fast imaging techniques are used to observe the plasma emission with the temperatures in the range of 5–60 ℃. It is shown that as the ambient temperature increases, an obviously increasing trend of emission intensity is observed, both for the atomic and ionic lines of Ca. Higher plasma temperature and electron density can be obtained at higher ambient temperature. The image results demonstrate that hotter and larger plasmas can be produced in water with the increase of ambient temperature. In addition, it is found that the changes of plasma emission and morphologies could be related to the changes of physical property parameters of water such as thermal expansivity and viscosity with ambient temperature. The results suggest that the ambient temperature has great influences on laser-induced plasma, which needs to be taken into account in underwater LIBS measurement, especially on-site marine applications.},

	abstract = {The LASIK procedure is a well established laser based treatment in ophthalmology. Nowadays it includes a cutting of the corneal tissue bases on ultra short pulses which are focused below the tissue surface to create an optical breakdown and hence a dissection of the tissue. The energy of the laser pulse is absorbed by non-linear processes that result in an expansion of a cavitation bubble and rupturing of the tissue. Due to a reduction of the duration of treatment the current development of ultra short laser systems points to higher repetition rates. This in turn results in a probable interaction between different cavitation bubbles of adjacent optical breakdowns. While the interaction of one single laser pulse with biological tissue is analyzed reasonably well experimentally and theoretically, the interaction of several spatial and temporal following pulses is scarcely determined yet. We present a high-speed photography analysis of cavitation bubble interaction for two spatial separated laser-induced optical breakdowns varying the laser pulse energy as well as the spatial distance. Depending on a change of these parameters different kinds of interactions such as a flattening and deformation of bubble shape, asymmetric water streams and jet formation were observed. The results of this research can be used to comprehend and optimize the cutting effect of ultra short pulse laser systems with high repetition rates (¿ 1 MHz).},

In this work, the influence of deep-sea high pressure environment on LIBS signals was investigated by using a compact LIBS-sea system developed by Ocean University of China for the in-situ chemical analysis of seawater. The results from the field measurements show that the liquid pressure has a significant effect on the LIBS signals. Higher peak intensity and larger line broadening were obtained as the pressure increases. By comparing the variations of the temperature and salinity with the LIBS signals, a weak correlation between them can be observed. Under high pressure conditions, the optimal laser energy was higher than that in air environment. When the laser energy exceeded 17 mJ, the effect of laser energy on the signal intensity weakened. The signal intensity decreases gradually at larger delays. The obtained results verified the feasibility of the LIBS technique for the deep-sea in-situ detection, and we hope this technology can contribute to surveying more deep-sea environments such as the hydrothermal vent regions.},

	abstract = {A significant portion of the carbon sequestration research being performed in the United States involves the risk assessment of injecting large quantities of carbon dioxide into deep saline aquifers. Leakage of CO2 has the potential to affect the quality of groundwater supplies in case contaminants migrate through underlying conduits. New remote sensing and near-surface monitoring technologies are needed to ensure that injection, abandoned, and monitoring wells are structurally sound, and that CO2 remains within the geologic storage reservoir. In this paper, we propose underwater laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (underwater LIBS) as an analytical method for monitoring naturally occurring elements that can act as tracers to detect a CO2 leak from storage sites. Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to measure Sr2+, Ca2+, K(+), and Li(+) in bulk solutions to ascertain the analytical performance of underwater LIBS. We compared the effect of NaCl, Na2CO3, and Na2SO4 on the analytes calibration curves to determine underwater LIBS' ability to analyze samples of sodium compounds. In all cases, the calibration curves showed a good linearity within 2 orders of magnitude. The limit of detections (LODs) obtained for K(+) (30±1 ppb) and Li(+) (60±2 ppb) were in ppb range, while higher LODs were observed for Ca(2+) (0.94±0.14 ppm) and Sr(2+) (2.89±0.11 ppm). Evaluation of the calibration curves for the analytes in mixed solutions showed dependence of the lines' intensity with the sodium compounds. The intensities increased respectively in the presence of dissolved NaCl and Na2SO4, whereas the intensities slightly decreased in the presence of Na2CO3. Finally, the capabilities of underwater LIBS to detect certain elements in the ppb or in the low ppm range make it particularly appealing for in situ monitoring of a CO2 leak.},

	abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been proven to be an attractive technique for the in-situ oceanic applications. However, when applying LIBS into deep-sea, the pressure effect caused by different ocean depth is inescapable and could have great influence on the LIBS signals. In this work, spectral characteristics of underwater LIBS were investigated as a function of pressure in the range from 0.1 to 45 MPa. A high-pressure chamber built in the laboratory was used to simulate the high-pressure environment of deep-sea. Optimal laser energy and detection delay were first determined under different pressure conditions and were shown to be independent on the external pressure. The increase in pressure has a significant impact both on the peak intensity and line broadening of the observed spectra. The peak intensity of Na, Li and K lines increases with the increasing pressure until a maximum intensity reached at 12.5 MPa. Above this value, the peak intensity decreases gradually up to 45 MPa. For Ca line, the maximum intensity was observed at 30 MPa. The line broadening keeps constant at low pressures from 0.1 to 10 MPa while it increases linearly at higher pressures, indicating a higher electron density caused by the compression eﬀect of the high external pressure. We also compared the spectral data obtained from the high-pressure chamber and from the field sea trials, and the good consistency between the laboratory data and sea-trial data suggested the key role of pressure effect on underwater LIBS signals for the practical deep-sea applications.},

The influence of time delay between two laser pulses on the underwater laser-induced plasma characteristics was investigated by means of fast imaging and spectroscopic techniques. In this study, we demonstrated that the LIBS signal intensity cannot be improved by using two simultaneously incident laser beams, even though the two induced plasmas fused together well. When using suitable shorter interpulse delay (40 μs), before the bubble is fully expanded (140 μs), more uniform volumetric emission with higher spectral intensity and longer plasma lifetime can be generated at a relatively low energy of the second laser (30 mJ). Finally, we also suggest that H and O produced from water by the LIBS plasma can be regarded as the internal standard for underwater DP-LIBS practical applications.},

	abstract = {Recently, molecular emissions from the laser-induced plasma in ambient gas have gained increasing interest; however, very little is known about the case in water solutions. In this work, we investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of molecular emissions, CaOH for instance, in underwater laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) by using time-resolved spectroscopy, spectral-resolved imaging, and shadowgraph techniques. It was shown that clear CaOH molecular bands can be observed in the spectrum at very early times after the laser pulse and presented a much longer lifetime and more homogeneous emission distribution compared with the Ca I and Ca II lines. Such unique characteristics of CaOH molecular emission inspired us to improve the performances of underwater LIBS by using the CaOH molecular bands instead of Ca I and Ca II lines. We demonstrated the excellent quantification results of CaOH with higher stability, less self-absorption, and reduced matrix effect. Meanwhile, the limit of detection (LOD) of Ca with the CaOH molecular band (2.46 ppm) is comparable to that with the atomic line of Ca I (2.07 ppm), and much lower than that with the ionic line of Ca II (13.81 ppm), indicating a good sensitivity of CaOH. This work gives not only some insights into the molecule formation mechanisms in underwater plasmas, but also provides new ideas to improve the analytical performances of underwater LIBS.},

	abstract = {Bubbles in liquids, soft and squeezy objects made of gas and vapour, yet so strong as to destroy any material and so mysterious as at times turning into tiny light bulbs, are the topic of the present report. Bubbles respond to pressure forces and reveal their full potential when periodically driven by sound waves. The basic equations for nonlinear bubble oscillation in sound ﬁelds are given, together with a survey of typical solutions. A bubble in a liquid can be considered as a representative example from nonlinear dynamical systems theory with its resonances, multiple attractors with their basins, bifurcations to chaos and not yet fully describable behaviour due to inﬁnite complexity. Three stability conditions are treated for stable trapping of bubbles in standing sound ﬁelds: positional, spherical and diffusional stability. Chemical reactions may become important in that respect, when reacting gases ﬁll the bubble, but the chemistry of bubbles is just touched upon and is beyond the scope of the present report. Bubble collapse, the runaway shrinking of a bubble, is presented in its current state of knowledge. Pressures and temperatures that are reached at this occasion are discussed, as well as the light emission in the form of short ﬂashes. Aspherical bubble collapse, as for instance enforced by boundaries nearby, mitigates most of the phenomena encountered in spherical collapse, but introduces a new effect: jet formation, the self-piercing of a bubble with a high velocity liquid jet. Examples of this phenomenon are given from light induced bubbles. Two oscillating bubbles attract or repel each other, depending on their oscillations and their distance. Upon approaching, attraction may change to repulsion and vice versa. When being close, they also shoot self-piercing jets at each other. Systems of bubbles are treated as they appear after shock wave passage through a liquid and with their branched ﬁlaments that they attain in standing sound ﬁelds. The N-bubble problem is formulated in the spirit of the n-body problem of astrophysics, but with more complicated interaction forces. Simulations are compared with three-dimensional bubble dynamics obtained by stereoscopic high speed digital videography.},

	abstract = {Using shadow photography, we observed microsecond time scale evolution of multiple cavitation bubbles, excited by tighty focused femtosecond laser pulse in water under supercritical power regime ({\textasciitilde}100 Pcr). In these extreme conditions high energy delivery into the microvolume of liquid sample leads to creation of single filament which becomes a source of cavitation region formation. When aberrations were added to the optical scheme the hot spots along the filament axis are formed. At high energies (more than 40J) filaments in these hot spots are fired and, as a result, complex pattern of cavitation bubbles is created. The bubbles can be isolated from each other or build exotic “drop-shaped” cavitation region, which evolution at the end of its “life”, before the final collapse, contains the jet emission. The dynamics of the cavitation pattern was investigated from pulse energy and focusing. We found that greater numerical aperture of the focusing optics leads to greater cavitation area length. The strong interaction between bubbles was also observed. This leads to a significant change of bubble evolution, which is not yet in accordance with Rayleigh model.},

The present theory unifies different classical bubble equations such as the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, the Gilmore equation, and the Keller-Miksis equation. Furthermore, we validated the unified theory with experimental data of bubbles with a variety in scales, sources, boundaries, and ambient conditions and showed the advantages of our theory over the classical theoretical models, followed by a discussion on the applicability of the present theory based on a comparison to simulation results with different numerical methods. Finally, as a demonstration of the potential of our theory, we modeled the complex multicycle bubble interaction with wide ranges of energy and phase differences and gained new physical insights into inter-bubble energy transfer and coupling of bubble-induced pressure waves.},

	abstract = {Cavitation is common in high-pressure homogenizers, and has severe negative effects such as noise and mechanical wear, but may also have a beneficial effect in promoting fragmentation. Greater knowledge concerning cavitation in the homogenizer valve is thus important in optimizing the design and utilization of emulsification equipment. The aim of this study was to locate the region of cavitation and to study its dependence on operating conditions. The cavitation in a model of a high-pressure homogenizer is examined in detail. A visualization technique, based on the scattering of light from cavitation bubbles in the flow, has been developed, tested and compared to acoustical measurements. Intense light scattering was observed in the gap of the valve, indicating cavitation bubble growth as well as collapse inside the gap. The scattering intensity increased with increasing inlet pressure and decreased with increasing back pressure. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of spherical laser-induced cavitation bubbles in water is investigated by plasma photography, time-resolved shadowgraphs and sensitive single-shot probe beam scattering that portrays the transition from initial nonlinear to late linear oscillations. The frequency of late oscillations yields the bubble’s gas content. Numerical simulations with an extended Gilmore model using plasma size as input and oscillation times as ﬁt parameter provide insights into experimentally not accessible bubble parameters and shock wave emission. Model extensions include a term covering the initial shock-driven acceleration of the bubble wall, an automated method determining shock front position and pressure decay and a complete energy balance for the partitioning of absorbed laser energy into vaporization, bubble and shock wave energy and dissipation through viscosity and condensation. These tools are used for analysing a scattering signal covering 102 oscillation cycles from a bubble with 36 μm maximum radius produced by a plasma with 1550 K average temperature. Predicted bubble wall velocities during expansion agree well with experimental data. Upon ﬁrst collapse, most energy was stored in the compressed liquid around the bubble and radiated away acoustically. The collapsed bubble contained more vapour than gas and had a pressure of 13.5 GPa. The decay of the rebound shock wave pressure with radius r was initially ∝r−1.8, and energy dissipation at the shock front heated the liquid near the bubble wall to temperatures above the superheat limit. The shock-induced temperature rise reduces damping during late bubble oscillations. Damping in ﬁrst collapse increases signiﬁcantly for small bubbles with less than 10 μm radius.},

The experimental as well as the visual observations indicate that a single collapsing cavity is also inﬂuenced by the dynamics of the surrounding cavities, which are very near to the collapsing cavity. The observed eﬀects and erosion patterns cannot be explained properly on the basis of a single cavity collapse and hence in this study a cavity cluster (group of cavities) has been considered to understand the mechanism of cavitational eﬀects. The eﬀect of intensity, frequency of ultrasound, initial size of the cluster and the fraction of energy transferred from the collapsing cavities to the surrounding cavities on the cavitational intensity quantiﬁed in terms of the pressure pulse generated at the collapse of cavities as well as the active zone of cavitation has been investigated using bubble/cavity dynamics equations, numerically. On the basis of the trends obtained, empirical correlations estimating the collapse pressure and active volume of cavitation, have been developed.},

	url = {https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/2188/},
	abstract = {Lithotripsy is at the forefront of treatment of kidney stones. By firing shock waves at the stone, it can be broken down into small fragments. Although the treatment is non-invasive, both short- and long-term side effects occur. In order to understand and rectify these shortcomings, lithotripsy has been the subject of ongoing research. Based on in vitro experiments, it has been ascertained that the cloud of cavitating bubble produced in the wake of the shock wave is a crucial element in the stone comminution process. Various solutions designed to maximize stone comminution and/or decrease tissue damage have been proposed over the years. However, the particulars of the comminution mechanism(s) are still undetermined. In this work, a numerical model of the two-phase flow inside an electrohydraulic lithotripter was used to provide additional insight in the behavior of the bubble cloud. The numerical model is based on an ensemble averaged two-phase flow model for a compressible liquid. The differential equations were discretized following the WENO shock capturing scheme in prolate spheroidal and cylindrical coordinate systems. The initial conditions for the flow field are estimated based on empirical observations and then validated by comparing the predicted pressure measurements and bubble cloud behavior against experimental values. In order to gain additional insight in the mechanism for stone comminution, a variety of relevant initial conditions were modeled. The following lithotripter configurations were analyzed: free-field, dual-pulse and single-pulse with an artificial stone at the focus. The impact of parameters such as the intensity of the initial shock wave and the pulse rate frequency (PRF) has been investigated. Based on an energy argument, conclusions regarding the effciency of stone comminution are presented. In addition, based on these conclusions, avenues for improvement of the numerical model are highlighted.},

	abstract = {The Rayleigh collapse time is the time it would take to shrink an empty spherical bubble in an inﬁnite liquid domain to zero size, which is a function of ambient pressure and initial bubble radius. If a solid boundary is located in the vicinity of the shrinking or collapsing bubble, then liquid ﬂow is hindered, such that the collapse time is prolonged. This can be quantiﬁed with the Rayleigh prolongation factor k. Here, we provide k for intermediate to smallest bubble to wall stand-off distances. It is measured with single laser-induced cavitation bubbles in water close to a solid boundary. Maximum bubble radii are determined from microscopic high-speed imaging at one million frames per second. Collapse times are measured acoustically via the acoustic transients emitted during bubble seeding and collapse. The experimental ﬁndings are compared, with good agreement, to numerical simulations based on a volume of ﬂuid method. As a result, a polynomial ﬁt of k versus stand-off distance is given for the near-wall bubble collapse in water. Then the inﬂuence of the viscosity on k is studied numerically in the near-wall regime.},

At a given position of the bubble with respect to the horizontal wall, the inclination of the jet increases with decreasing distance between the bubble and the second, vertical wall. A bubble generated at equal distances from the walls develops a jet that is directed in their bisection. The penetration of the jet into the opposite bubble surface leads to the formation of an asymmetric toroidal bubble that is perpendicular to the jet direction. At a large distance from the rigid walls, the toroidal bubble collapses in the radial direction, eventually disintegrating into tiny microbubbles. When the bubble is in contact with the horizontal wall at its maximum expansion, the toroidal ring collapses in both radial and toroidal directions, starting from the bubble part opposite to the vertical wall, and the bubble achieves a crescent shape at the moment of second collapse. The bubble oscillation is accompanied by a strong migration along the horizontal wall.},

The input parameters of the numerical method include the laser pulse duration, the size of the plasma, and the maximally extended cavitation bubble, which are measured utilizing a high time-resolved shadowgraph system. The calculation results are verified by shock wave observation experiments at the cavitation bubble expansion stage. The relative errors of the radiuses and the velocity of the shock wave front reach the maximum value of 45\% at 5 ns after breakdown and decrease to less than 20\% within 20 ns. The high attenuation characteristics of the shock wave after the optical breakdown are predicted by the numerical method. The quick time and space evolution of the shock wave are carefully analyzed. The normalized shock wave width is found to be independent of the laser energy and duration, and the energy partition ratio is around 2.0 using the nanosecond pulsed laser.},

Three situations are studied for each of the two configurations: (i) the Bjerknes force being dominant, (ii) the buoyancy force being dominant and (iii) the two forces being approximately balanced. For case (iii), we further consider two subcases, where both the balanced Bjerknes and buoyancy forces are weak or strong. When the Bjerknes and buoyancy forces are approximately balanced over the pulsation, some representative bubble behaviours are observed: the bubble near free surface is found to split into two parts jetting away from each other for small

Its subsequent dynamics near a flat solid boundary is studied in dependence on the distance of the bubble to the boundary by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations with the help of the open source software environment OpenFOAM. Implemented is the finite-volume method for discretization of the equations of motion and the volume-of-fluid method for capturing the interface between the bubble interior and exterior. The bubble contains a small amount of noncondensable gas that is treated as an ideal gas. The liquid is water obeying the Tait equation. Surface tension is included where necessary. The evolution of the bubble shape and a selection of pressure and velocity fields are given for normalized distances D∗=D/Rmax between 0 and 3 (D is the initial distance of the bubble center to the boundary and Rmax is the maximum radius the bubble would attain without any boundary). The value Rmax= 500 μm is chosen for the study. Normal axial-jet formation (∼100 m/s) by axial flow focusing is found for 0.24≤D∗≤3 and the change to a different type of axial-jet formation (∼1000 m/s) by annular-liquid-flow collision for bubbles very close to the solid boundary (0≤D∗≤0.2). The transition region (0.2{\textless}D∗{\textless}0.24) is characterized by additional inbound and outbound annular jets. Remarkably, the inclusion of the viscosity of the water is decisive to get the fast jets.},

	abstract = {Energy concentration and loss due to a violent collapsing bubble are essential phenomena to many applications such as cavitation erosion, biomedical ultrasonics, sonochemistry, cavitation cleaning and underwater explosions. It has been generally known that the energy of a bubble system is radiated away as an acoustic wave and dissipated by viscosity. However, there is no study in the scientific literature on the time history of the energy of a bubble system in a compressible flow. Here we have introduced the local energy of a non-spherical bubble system, consisting of the energy of the interior gas, the interface and the exterior liquid in the inner asymptotic region. The local energy determines the local bubble and flow dynamics, including the concentration of energy, stress and momentum. We obtain a simple formula for the radiated energy associated with acoustic radiation in terms of the bubble volume history. We perform calculations of the energy history for a transient bubble in a compressible liquid in an infinite domain, subject to buoyancy and near a rigid boundary, respectively. Our calculations show that the local energy of a transient bubble follows a step function in time, being nearly conserved for most of each cycle of oscillation but decreasing rapidly and significantly at bubble inception and at the end of collapse, due to the emission of steep pressure waves or shock waves. The loss of the local energy of the bubble system due to the emission of steep pressure waves and the associated damping of the bubble oscillation are diminished by buoyancy effects and decrease with the buoyancy parameter. Similarly, the loss of the local energy of a bubble system is diminished by the presence of a rigid boundary and decreases with the proximity of the bubble to the boundary. We also analyse the energy concentration of single bubble sonoluminescence in a standing acoustic wave.},

            Ultrasonic sonochemistry and pulsed laser ablation in liquids (LAL) are modern techniques for materials synthesis that are in different ways linked to the formation and collapse of cavitation bubbles. We provide an overview of the physics of laser-induced and acoustically driven bubble oscillations and then describe how the high pressures and temperatures associated with ablation and bubble collapse, as well as emitted shock waves, take part in material synthesis inside and around the bubble. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of sonochemical synthesis and modification, and on a step-by-step account of the events from laser ablation through interaction of ablation products with the surrounding liquid up to the modification or aggregation of particles within the bubble. Both sonochemistry and LALs yield nanostructured materials and colloidal nanoparticles with unique properties. The synthesis process has been demonstrated to be scalable.},

The numerical results are matched to the experimental radius-time curve extracted from high-speed photographs by tuning the model parameters. Trajectories of tracer particles are calculated and used to model the experimental process of the PTV measurement.

	abstract = {Phantom-based performance test methods are critically needed to support development and clinical translation of emerging photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) devices. While phantoms have been recently developed for macroscopic photoacoustic imaging systems, there is an unmet need for well-characterized tissue-mimicking materials (TMMs) and phantoms suitable for evaluating PAM systems. Our objective was to develop and characterize a suitable dermis-mimicking TMM based on polyacrylamide hydrogels and demonstrate its utility for constructing image quality phantoms. TMM formulations were optically characterized over 400-1100 nm using integrating sphere spectrophotometry and acoustically characterized using a pulse through-transmission method over 8-24 MHz with highly confident extrapolation throughout the usable band of the PAM system. This TMM was used to construct a spatial resolution phantom containing gold nanoparticle point targets and a penetration depth phantom containing slanted tungsten filaments and blood-filled tubes. These phantoms were used to characterize performance of a custom-built PAM system. The TMM was found to be broadly tunable and specific formulations were identified to mimic human dermis at an optical wavelength of 570 nm and acoustic frequencies of 10-50 MHz. Imaging results showed that tungsten filaments yielded 1.1-4.2 times greater apparent maximum imaging depth than blood-filled tubes, which may overestimate real-world performance for vascular imaging applications. Nanoparticles were detectable only to depths of 120-200 µm, which may be due to the relatively weaker absorption of single nanoparticles vs. larger targets containing high concentration of hemoglobin. The developed TMMs and phantoms are useful tools to support PAM device characterization and optimization, streamline regulatory decision-making, and accelerate clinical translation.},

	abstract = {A bubble initiated near a rigid boundary may be almost in contact with the boundary because of its expansion and migration to the boundary, where a thin layer of water forms between the bubble and the boundary thereafter. This phenomenon is modelled using the weakly compressible theory coupled with the boundary integral method. The wall effects are modelled using the imaging method. The numerical instabilities caused by the near contact of the bubble surface with the boundary are handled by removing a thin layer of water between them and joining the bubble surface with its image to the boundary. Our computations correlate well with experiments for both the first and second cycles of oscillation. The time history of the energy of a bubble system follows a step function, reducing rapidly and significantly because of emission of shock waves at inception of a bubble and at the end of collapse but remaining approximately constant for the rest of the time. The bubble starts being in near contact with the boundary during the first cycle of oscillation when the dimensionless stand-off distance γ = s/Rm ¡ 1, where s is the distance of the initial bubble centre from the boundary and Rm is the maximum bubble radius. This leads to (i) the direct impact of a high-speed liquid jet on the boundary once it penetrates through the bubble, (ii) the direct contact of the bubble at high temperature and high pressure with the boundary, and (iii) the direct impingement of shock waves on the boundary once emitted. These phenomena have clear potential to damage the boundary, which are believed to be part of the mechanisms of cavitation damage.},

	abstract = {We analyze systematically the acoustic transients emitted during the collapse of a laser-induced cavitation bubble for 0.4 ≤ γ ≤ 5.2. γ is the standoff parameter, the ratio of the distance between the bubble's nucleation place and its maximum size. At the bubble collapse, the acoustic signals recorded contain several pressure peaks with rising times as fast as 18 ns. The time delay, Δ t, between these peaks is a few hundred nanoseconds apart for bubbles nucleated close to the boundary and decreases with γ. The pressure maxima correspond to shock fronts emitted around the time the bubble reaches its minimum volume and is correlated with the high-speed video recordings of the bubble dynamics. We also show that the amplitude ratio of the first to second acoustic transient is strongly dependent on γ. The experimental results are complemented with numerical simulations based on the Volume-of-Fluid method. The simulated results help clarify the physical mechanisms leading to the generation of acoustic transients and unveil in detail the morphology of the bubble approaching its minimum volume, a feature that cannot be resolved with the high-speed data. Furthermore, the numerical results reveal that the impact of the liquid jet on the rigid wall ensues a local increase in pressure over a significant time period, contrary to the shock wave formed during bubble collapse, which produces a sharp transient pressure peak that propagates radially outwards along the rigid wall. We also discuss the validity and shortcomings of the simulation and how to improve them in the future.},

This phenomenon is modeled using the potential flow theory and the boundary integral method. The Green’s function is obtained to satisfy the impenetrable conditions at the rigid boundaries using the method of images with the corner angle α = π/k, where k is a natural number. To evaluate the numerical model, experiments were carried out with a spark-generated bubble in water and recorded using a high-speed camera. The predicted bubble shapes are in excellent agreement with those from the experiments. A jet forms toward the end of the collapse, pointing to the corner when initiated at the bisector of the two walls but pointing to the near wall and inclined to the corner when initiated near one of the two walls. The Kelvin impulse theory predicts the jet direction well. As compared to a bubble near a flat wall, the oscillation period and the jet width increase but the jet velocity decreases. The bubble migrates away from the near wall and the corner during its expansion and moves back toward them during its collapse, but at a much larger speed and amplitude. A velocity stagnation point forms at the start of the collapse, and a high-pressure zone is generated at the base of the jet during the late stages of the collapse, which drives the jet and the bubble toward the near wall and the corner.},

	abstract = {An experiment is performed using high-speed photography to elucidate the behaviours of jets formed by the interactions of two laser-induced tandem bubbles produced axisymmetrically for a range of dimensionless interaction parameters such as the bubble size ratio, x1D709 , the distance between the two cavitation bubbles, l₀ , and the time difference in bubble generation, x0394x1D703 . A strong interaction occurs for l₀{\textless}1 . The first bubble produced (bubble A) deforms because of the rapid growth of the second bubble (bubble B) to create a pulsed conical jet, sometimes with spray formation at the tip, formed by the small amount of water confined between the two bubbles. This phenomenon is followed by bubble penetration, toroidal bubble collapse, and the subsequent fast contraction of bubble B accompanied by a fine jet. The formation mechanism of the conical jet is similar to that of a water spike developed in air from a deformed free surface of a single growing bubble; however, the pressures of the gases surrounding each type of jet differ. The jet behaviours can be controlled by manipulating the interaction parameters; the jet velocity is significantly affected by x1D709 and l₀ , but less so by x0394x1D703 for x0394x1D703{\textgreater}x0394x1D703$_{\textrm{c}}$ ( x0394x1D703$_{\textrm{c}}$ being the critical birth-time difference). The optimum time of jet impact, at which bubble A reaches its maximum volume, depends on x0394x1D703 . It is generally later for larger values of x1D709 . A pulsed jet could be used to create small pores in a cell membrane; therefore, the reported method may be useful for application in tandem-bubble sonoporation.},

To this end, total internal reflection (TIR) shadowmetry is developed, a technique based on TIR and the imaging of shadows of an optical structure on a polished glass surface. The measurements are performed at frame rates up to 480 kHz. Simultaneous high-speed imaging of the bubble shape at up to 89 kHz allows relating the evolution of the film thickness to the bubble dynamics. With a typical maximum bubble radius of 410 µm, we varied the nondimensional stand-off distance γ from 0.47 to 1.07. We find that during the first collapse phase, the bubble does not come in direct contact with the solid surface. Instead, when the bubble collapses, the jet impacts on a liquid film that always resides between the bubble and solid. At jet impact, it is 5–40 µm thick, depending on γ. Also, during rebound, at any given point in time, most or all of the then overall toroidal bubble is not in contact with the solid surface.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bubble dynamics near a rigid boundary are associated with wide and important applications in cavitation erosion in many industrial systems and medical ultrasonics. This classical problem is revisited with the following two developments. Firstly, computational studies on the problem have commonly been based on an incompressible fluid model, but the compressible effects are essential in this phenomenon. Consequently, a bubble usually undergoes significantly damped oscillation in practice. In this paper this phenomenon will be modelled using weakly compressible theory and a modified boundary integral method for an axisymmetric configuration, which predicts the damped oscillation. Secondly, the computational studies so far have largely been concerned with the first cycle of oscillation. However, a bubble usually oscillates for a few cycles before it breaks into much smaller ones. Cavitation erosion may be associated with the recollapse phase when the bubble is initiated more than the maximum bubble radius away from the boundary. Both the first and second cycles of oscillation will be modelled. The toroidal bubble formed towards the end of the collapse phase is modelled using a vortex ring model. The repeated topological changes of the bubble are traced from a singly connected to a doubly connected form, and vice versa. This model considers the energy loss due to shock waves emitted at minimum bubble volumes during the beginning of the expansion phase and around the end of the collapse phase. It predicts damped oscillations, where both the maximum bubble radius and the oscillation period reduce significantly from the first to second cycles of oscillation. The damping of the bubble oscillation is alleviated by the existence of the rigid boundary and reduces with the standoff distance between them. Our computations correlate well with the experimental data (Philipp \& Lauterborn, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 361, 1998, pp. 75–116) for both the first and second cycles of oscillation. We have successively reproduced the bubble ring in direct contact with the rigid boundary at the end of the second collapse phase, a phenomenon that was suggested to be one of the major causes of cavitation erosion by experimental studies.},

The rate equation was numerically solved to calculate the evolution of the electron density during the laser pulse and to determine the absorption coefficient and energy density of the plasma. For nanosecond laser pulses, the generation of free electrons in distilled water is initiated by multiphoton ionization but then dominated by cascade ionization. For shorter laser pulses, multiphoton ionization gains ever more importance, and collision and recombination losses during breakdown diminish. The corresponding changes in the evolution of the free carrier density explain the reduction of the energy threshold for breakdown and of the plasma energy density observed with decreasing laser pulse duration. By solving the rate equation, we could also explain the complex pulse duration dependence of plasma transmission found in previous experiments. Good quantitative agreement was found between calculated and measured values for the breakdown threshold, plasma absorption coefficient, and plasma energy density.},

The contributions of both optical and acoustical phonons to electron loss and diffusion must be included. The breakdown field E sub B is calculated by solving an eigenvalue equation obtained from the diffusion transport equation. Simple models and interpretations of the diffusion equation afford physical insight into breakdown and render the breakdown conditions predictable.

	abstract = {This paper interrogates the intersections between bubble dynamics and classical nucleation theory (CNT) towards constructing a model that describes intermediary nucleation events between the extrema of cavitation and boiling. We employ Zeldovich’s hydrodynamic approach to obtain a description of bubble nuclei that grow simultaneously via hydrodynamic excitation by the acoustic field and vapour transport. By quantifying the relative dominance of both mechanisms, it is then possible to discern the extent to which viscosity, inertia, surface tension and vapour transport shape the growth of bubble nuclei through non-dimensional numbers that naturally arise within the theory. The first non-dimensional number Φ12/Φ2 is analogous to the Laplace number, representing the balance between surface tension and inertial constraints to viscous effects. The second non-dimensional number δ represents how enthalpy transport into the bubble can reduce nucleation rates by cooling the surrounding liquid. This formulation adds to the current understanding of ultrasound bubble nucleation by accounting for bubble dynamics during nucleation, quantifying the physical distinctions between “boiling” and “cavitation” bubbles through non-dimensional parameters, and outlining the characteristic timescales of nucleation according to the growth mechanism of bubbles throughout the histotripsy temperature range. We observed in our simulations that viscous effects control the process of ultrasound nucleation in water-like media throughout the 0–120 °C temperature range, although this dominance decreases with increasing temperatures. Enthalpy transport was found to reduce nucleation rates for increasing temperatures. This effect becomes significant at temperatures above 30 °C and favours the creation of fewer nuclei that are larger in size. Conversely, negligible enthalpy transport at lower temperatures can enable the nucleation of dense clusters of small nuclei, such as cavitation clouds. We find that nuclei growth as modelled by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation occurs over shorter timescales than as modelled by vapour-dominated growth. This suggests that the first stage of bubble nuclei growth is hydrodynamic, and vapour transport effects can only be observed over longer timescales. Finally, we propose that this framework can be used for comparison between different experiments in bubble nucleation, towards standardisation and dosimetry of protocols.},

	abstract = {The quasi-stable sheet cavitation produced in a small Venturi channel is investigated using a fast synchrotron x-ray imaging technique aided with conventional high speed photography. The use of x rays instead of visible light solves cavitation opacity related issues, and x-ray phase contrast-based edge enhancement enables high-definition visualization of the internal two-phase morphology. The simultaneous acquisition of time-resolved velocity and void fraction fields through post-processing of the recorded x-ray images reveals, for the first time, the complex diphasic flow structures inside the sheet cavity, which is essentially divided into six characteristic parts. Distinct from the current mainstream view, the globally steady sheet cavitation is found to be characterized by a weak but constantly existing re-entrant flow that can penetrate the entire cavity. The turbulent velocity fluctuations inside the sheet cavity are also investigated. The turbulence level in the reverse flow region is observed to be as low as in the outer main flow, demonstrating the relatively steady status of the re-entrant flow. Unlike the streamwise and cross-stream fluctuations, the shear stress appears to be weakly correlated with the velocity gradient. The collapse of the vapor phase and the vaporization at the upstream cavity interface are found to be the primary causes of shear stress intensification.},

	abstract = {Cavitation damage is a micro, high-speed, multi-phase complex phenomenon caused by the near-wall bubble group collapse. The current numerical simulation method of cavitation mainly focuses on the collapse impact of a single cavitation bubble. The large-scale simulation of the cavitation bubble group collapse is difficult to perform and has not been studied, to the best of our knowledge. In this study, the equivalent model of impact loading of acoustic bubble collapse micro-jets is proposed to study the cavitation erosion damage of materials. Based on the theory of the micro-jet and the water hammer effect of the liquid–solid impact, an equivalent model of impact loading of a single acoustic bubble collapse micro-jet is established under the principle of deformation equivalence. Since the acoustic bubbles can be considered uniformly distributed in a small enough area, an equivalent model of impact loading of multiple acoustic bubble collapse micro-jets in a micro-segment can be derived based on the equivalent results of impact loading of a single acoustic bubble collapse micro-jet. In fact, the equivalent methods of cavitation damage loading for single and multiple near-wall acoustic bubble collapse micro-jets are formed. The verification results show the law of cavitation deformation of concrete using equivalent loading is consistent with that of a micro-jet simulation, and the average relative errors and the mean square errors are insignificant. The equivalent method of impact loading proposed in this paper has high accuracy and can greatly improve the calculation efficiency, which provides technical support for numerical simulation of concrete cavitation.},

The study originates from the discordance of observations between the theoretical investigations of the sonochemical activity of the single acoustic cavitation bubble in function of the acoustic frequency, in one hand, and the experimental findings regarding the optimal frequency condition, mainly in terms of pollutant degradation, in the other hand. A single bubble and an up-scaled model of the sonochemical activity are suggested and simulations were conducted based on both of them over the frequencies 20, 200, 300, 360, 443, 500, 600 and 800 kHz under an oxygen atmosphere. The results reveal that the sonochemical production at single bubble scale is monotonously decreasing with the increase of frequency, while all the products demonstrate an absolute optimum of sonochemical production at 200 kHz, except HO• that attains its maximum molar yield under 300 kHz. Besides, the production of the predominant species, namely HO2•, HO• and O3, manifests a clear rebound at 500 kHz. All the present results were compared to and confirmed by experimental findings, while the scalability of the concentrations of sonochemically produced species was discussed using a parameter we introduced as “the mass focusing factor”.},

After the nuclei seeding, the experimental study of the nuclei population dynamics with pressure and time was carried out. It is found that as the pressure decreases, the number density of larger size nuclei decreases, while the number density of smaller size nuclei increases. In the measured size range, the maximum value of number density of the nuclei size distribution increases.

The results of numerical simulation show that the oscillation phases of bubbles are delayed to a certain extent at different positions in the bubble cluster, but the radii of bubbles during oscillation do not differ too much at different positions. Furthermore, directivity of the acoustic scattering of bubbles is obvious. The scattered acoustic pressures of bubbles are different at the different positions inside and outside of the bubble cluster. The scattering acoustic fields of a spherical bubble cluster depend on the driving pressure amplitude, driving frequency, the equilibrium radii of bubbles, bubble number and the radius of the spherical bubble cluster.

The pressure frequency spectra obtained in our experiments (from more than 1.5 million cavitation collapsing events) show that the expected prominent shockwave pressure peak was barely detected for ethanol and glycerol, particularly at low input powers, but was consistently observed for the 1:1 ethanol–water solution as well as in water, with a slight shift in peak frequency for the solution. We also report two distinct features of shock waves in raising the frequency peak at MHz (inherent) and contributing to the raising of sub-harmonics (periodic). Empirically constructed acoustic pressure maps revealed significantly higher overall pressure amplitudes for the ethanol–water solution than for other liquids. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis revealed that mist-like patterns are developed in ethanol–water solution leading to higher pressures.},

In these applications, the effect mechanism of liquid surface tension on improving the efficiency of acoustic cavitation is a crucial concern for researchers. In this study, the effects of liquid surface tension on the dynamics of an ultrasonic driven bubble near a rigid wall, which could be the main mechanism of efficiency improvement in the applications of acoustic cavitation, were investigated at the microscale level. A synchronous high-speed microscopic imaging method was used to clearly record the temporary evolution of single acoustic cavitation bubble in the liquids with different surface tension. Meanwhile, the bubble dynamic characteristics, such as the position and time of bubble collapse, the size and stability of the bubbles, the speed of bubble boundaries and the micro-jets, were analyzed and compared. In the case of the single bubbles near a rigid wall, it was found that low surface tension reduces the stability of the bubbles in the liquid medium. Meanwhile, the bubbles collapse earlier and farther from the rigid wall in the liquids with lower surface tension. In addition, the surface tension has no significant influence on the speed of the first micro-jet, but it can substantially increase the speed of second and the third micro-jets after the first collapse of the bubble. These effects of liquid surface tension on the bubble dynamics can explain the mechanism of surfactants in numerous fields of acoustic cavitation for facilitating its optimization and application.},

Results show that the relative computational cost of the methods depends upon the degree of bubble polydispersity.

A moment-based method addresses this shortcoming. It uses a Gaussian closure and is augmented via long short-term memory recurrent neural networks for high-order statistics.

The main results are as follows. (1) The effects of two parallel walls can be classified by the ratio of the gap between the walls to the maximum bubble radius. If the ratio{\textgreater}5.0 the bubble shape is almost sphere. The wall effect remarkably appears for the ratio{\textless}3.0 and the bubble deforms to be dumbbell- or cone-like shape. (2) When the gap between the walls is small, the single bubble is finally divided into two bubbles owing to the large lateral pressure. The rebound of each bubble causes impulsive pressure and damages the upper and lower wall surface. Especially, if the bubble is not created at the center between the walls, the collapse phase shift among the divided bubbles brings the further damage on the wall surface. (3) The computed motion of the bubble without non-condensable gases well explains the dumbbell- or cone-shaped bubble deformation.},

	abstract = {With the help of a hypothesis first proposed by Mirkwood and Betbe, the partial differential equations for the flow of a compressible liquid surrounding a spherical bubble are reduced to a single total differential equation for the bubble-wall velocity. The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis represents an extrapolation of acoustic theory and would be expected to be most accurate when all liquid velocities are small compared to the velocity of sound in the liquid. However, the present theory is found to agree quite well with the only available numerical solution of the partial differential equations which extends up to a bubble-wall velocity of 2.2 times the sonic velocity. In the particular case of a bubble with constant (or zero) internal pressure, an analytic solution is obtained for the bubble-wall velocity which is valid over the entire velocity range for which the Mirkwood-Bethe hypothesis holds. In the more general situation, when the internal pressure is not constant, simple solutions are obtained only when the bubble-wall velocity is considerably less than sonic velocity. These approximate integral solutions are obtained by neglecting various powers of the ratio of wall velocity to sonic velocity. The zero-order approximation coincides with the equations for a bubble in an incompressible liquid derived by Rayleigh; the first-order approximation agrees with the solution obtained by Herring using a different method. The second-order approximation is presented here for the first time. The complete effects of surface tension, and the principal effects of viscosity, as long as the density variation in the liquid is not great, can be included in the analysis by suitably modifying the boundary conditions at the bubble wall. These effects are equivalent to a change in the internal bubble pressure. With this change, the same equations for the bubble-wall velocity are applicable to a viscous liquid with surface tension. Conditions under which the effects of surface tension and viscosity can be neglected are also determined. First and second-order approximations to the velocity and pressure fields throughout the liquid are derived. From these expressions, the acoustic energy radiated is calculated.},

The filament becomes a source of numerous spherical shock waves whose radius tends to saturate with the increase of energy. These overlapping waves create a contrast cylindrical shock wave. The laser-induced shock wave parameters such as shape, amplitude and speed can be effectively controlled by varying energy and focusing geometry of the femtosecond pulse. Aberrations added to the optical scheme lead to multiple dotted plasma sources for shock wave formation, spaced along the optical axis. Increasing the laser energy launches filaments at each dot that enhance the length of the entire filament and as a result, the shock impact on the material.},

Apart from bubbles observed in water and on a material surface, single-pulsed lasers induce double bubbles. The dynamic characteristics of double bubbles were investigated using a high-speed camera. The residual stress and the surface morphology were measured to evaluate the strengthening effect. The compound strengthening mechanism of double bubbles with high temperature and high pressure was discussed. The results show that the transient characteristics of double bubbles in water and on the surface of the material are different, such as the pulsation period and the size, although the two bubbles are induced at the same time. And the strengthening performance of double bubbles depends on the distance between the focus point of the laser and the material surface. This study provides a practical strengthening method based on double bubbles induced by nanosecond pulsed laser.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We assessed the effectiveness and safety of holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy for managing upper urinary tract calculi in a prospective cohort of 598 patients. Materials and Methods: Ureteroscopic holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy was performed in 598 patients between 1993 and 1999. Calculi were located in the distal ureter in 39.6\% of cases, mid ureter in 18.6\%, proximal ureter in 32.4\% and kidney in 9.4\%. Patients were treated on an outpatient basis with various flexible and semirigid endoscopes. Of the cases 59\% were referred as previous treatment failures. Patients were assessed 6 to 12 weeks postoperatively with repeat plain x-ray and ultrasound or excretory urography for late obstructive complications.
Results: The overall stone-free rate was 97\%. As stratified by location, the stone-free rate was 98\% in the distal ureter, 100\% in the mid ureter, 97\% in the proximal ureter and 84\% in the kidney. Fragmentation was incomplete in 6\% of cases and secondary intervention was required in 6\%. The overall complication rate was 4\%. New onset ureteral stricture developed postoperatively in 0.35\% of patients.
Conclusions: Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is a highly effective and safe treatment modality for managing ureteral and a proportion of intrarenal calculi on an outpatient basis. The effectiveness and versatility of the holmium laser combined with small rigid or flexible endoscopes make it our modality of choice for ureteroscopic lithotripsy.},

Yet, the mechanism through which material is eroded remains vague, and the extremely fast and localized dynamics that lead to material damage has not been resolved. Here, we reveal the decisive mechanism that leads to energy focusing during the non-spherical collapse of cavitation bubbles and eventually results to the erosion of hardened metals. We show that a single cavitation bubble at ambient pressure close to a metal surface causes erosion only if a non-axisymmetric energy self-focusing is at play. The bubble during its collapse emits shockwaves that under certain conditions converge to a single point where the remaining gas phase is driven to a shockwave-intensified collapse. We resolve the conditions under which this self-focusing enhances the collapse and damages the solid. High-speed imaging of bubble and shock wave dynamics at sub-picosecond exposure times is correlated to the shockwaves recorded with large bandwidth hydrophones. The material damage from several metallic materials is detected in situ and quantified ex-situ via scanning electron microscopy and confocal profilometry. With this knowledge, approaches to mitigate cavitation erosion or to even enhance the energy focusing are within reach.},

The shear ﬂow produced by this event has many applications, examples of which are surface cleaning, cell membrane poration and enhanced cooling. Yet the magnitude and spatio-temporal distribution of the wall shear stress are not well understood, neither experimentally nor by simulations. Here we solve the ﬂow in the boundary layer using an axisymmetric compressible volume-of-ﬂuid solver from the OpenFOAM framework and discuss the resulting wall shear stress generated for a non-dimensional distance, γ = 1.0 (γ = h/Rmax, where h is the distance of the initial bubble centre to the boundary, and Rmax is the maximum spherical equivalent radius of the bubble). The calculation of the wall shear stress is found to be reliable once the ﬂow region with constant shear rate in the boundary layer is determined. Very high wall shear stresses of 100 kPa are found during the early spreading of the jet, followed by complex ﬂows composed of annular stagnation rings and secondary vortices. Although the simulated bubble dynamics agrees very well with experiments, we obtain only qualitative agreement with experiments due to inherent experimental challenges.},

Von Karman’s study of this classical physics problem showed that the pressure on the bottom surface of the impacting body approaches infinity for flat impacts. Yet, in contrast to the high pressures found from experience and in previous studies, we show that a flat-bottomed cylinder impacting a pool of liquid can decrease the local pressure sufficiently to cavitate the liquid. Cavitation occurs because the liquid is slightly compressible and impact creates large pressure waves that reflect from the free surface to form negative pressure regions. We find that an impact velocity as low as {\textasciitilde}3 m/s suffices to cavitate the liquid and propose a new cavitation number to predict cavitation onset in low-speed solid-liquid impact-scenarios. These findings imply that localized cavitation could occur in impacts such as boat slamming, cliff jumping, and ocean landing of spacecraft.},

	abstract = {The evolution of acoustic Lichtenberg figure (ALF) in ultrasound fields is studied using high-speed photography. It is observed that bubbles travel along the branch to the aggregation region of an ALF, promoting the possibility of large bubble or small cluster formation. Large bubbles move away from the aggregation region while sur­ rounding bubbles are attracted into this structure, and a bubble transportation cycle arises in the cavitation field. A simplified model consisting of a spherical cluster and a chain of bubbles is developed to explain this phe­ nomenon. The interaction of the two units is analyzed using a modified expression for the secondary Bjerknes force in this system. The model reveals that clusters can attract bubbles on the chain within a distance of 2 mm, leading to a bubble transportation process from the chain to the bubble cluster. Many factors can affect this process, including the acoustic pressure, frequency, bubble density, and separation distance. The larger the bubble in the cluster, the broader the attraction region. Therefore, the presence of large bubbles might enhance the process in this system. Local disturbances in bubble density could destroy the ALF structure. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with the experimental phenomena.},

	abstract = {We present a model developed for studying the generation of stable cavitation bubbles and their motion in a three-dimensional volume of liquid with axial symmetry under the effect of finite-amplitude phased array focused ultrasound. The density of bubbles per unit volume is determined by a nonlinear law which is a thresholddependent function of the negative acoustic pressure reached in the liquid, in which nuclei are initially distributed. The nonlinear mutual interaction of ultrasound and bubble oscillations is modeled by a nonlinear coupled differential system formed by the wave and a Rayleigh-Plesset equations, for which both the pressure and the bubble oscillation variables are unknown. The system, which accounts for nonlinearity, dispersion, and attenuation due to the bubbles, is solved by numerical approximations. The nonlinear acoustic pressure field is then used to evaluate the primary Bjerknes force field and to predict the subsequent motion of bubbles. In order to illustrate the procedure, a medium-high and a low ultrasonic frequency configurations are assumed. Simulation results show where bubbles are generated, the nonlinear effects they have on ultrasound, and where they are relocated. Despite many physical restrictions and thanks to its particularities (two nonlinear coupled fields, bubble generation, bubble motion), the numerical model used in this work gives results that show qualitative coherence with data observed experimentally in the framework of stable cavitation and suggest their usefulness in some application contexts.},

	abstract = {This work reveals that the dynamic response of a spherical cap bubble in contact with a rigid wall depends on the effective contact angle at the instant prior to collapse. This parameter allows us to discriminate between two regimes in which the mechanisms of interaction between the collapsing bubble and its surrounding medium differ signiﬁcantly: when the contact angle is smaller than 90◦, a classical jet directed towards the wall is observed, whereas if the initial contact angle is larger than 90◦, an annular re-entrant jet parallel to the wall appears. We show that this change of behaviour can be explained using the impulse potential ﬂow theory for small times, which shows the presence of a singularity on the initial acceleration of the contact line when the contact angle is larger than 90◦. Direct numerical simulations show that although viscosity regularises the solution at t {\textgreater} 0, the solution remains singular at t = 0. In these circumstances, numerical and experimental results show that the collapse of ﬂat bubbles can eventually lead to the formation of a vortex ring that unexpectedly induces long-range effects. The role of the bubble geometry at the instant of maximum expansion on the overall collapse process is shown to be well captured by the impulse potential ﬂow theory, which can be generalised easily to other bubble shapes. These results may ﬁnd direct application in the interpretation of geophysical ﬂows as well as the control and design of biomedical, naval, manufacturing and sonochemistry applications.},

By combining numerical and analytical analyses with experiments, we identify two limiting conditions of the particle-bubble bounce and the particle-boundary impact respectively in terms of the initial relative distance between the particle and the bubble, and the stand-off distance of the bubble against the boundary.

The field pressure near the rigid boundary, which is induced by the oscillating bubble pair, and the high-speed water jet at the collapse stage, form the main focus of the analysis. This reveals that a horizontal configuration of the bubble pair retards the strength of the bubble jet towards the boundary, whilst a vertical configuration, especially with differently-sized bubbles, can enhance the bubble collapse.

The radial and translational motions, as well as the resultant acoustic emissions of two interacting cavitation bubbles in viscoelastic tissues were numerically investigated. Due to the bubble–bubble interactions, a remarkable suppression effect on the small bubble, whereas a slight enhancement effect on the large one were observed within the acoustic exposure parameters and the initial radii of the bubbles examined in this paper. Moreover, as the initial distance between bubbles increases, the strong suppression effect is reduced gradually and it could effectively enhance the nonlinear dynamics of bubbles, exactly as the bifurcation diagrams exhibit a similar mode of successive period doubling to chaos. Correspondingly, the resultant acoustic emissions present a progressive evolution of harmonics, subharmonics, ultraharmonics and broadband components in the frequency spectra. In addition, with the elasticity and/or viscosity of the surrounding medium increasing, both the nonlinear dynamics and translational motions of bubbles were reduced prominently. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the nonlinear behaviors and acoustic emissions of two interacting cavitation bubbles in viscoelastic media, it may contribute to optimizing and monitoring the cavitation-mediated biomedical applications.},

The effects of two important factors that strongly affect the dynamics of a single acoustic cavitation bubble, namely, the initial bubble radius and the standoff distance, were investigated in this work. The temporal evolution of the bubble was recorded using high speed microphotography. Meanwhile, the time of bubble collapse and the characteristics of the liquid jets were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the intensity of the acoustic cavitation, which is characterized by the time of bubble collapse and the liquid jet speed, reaches the optimum level under suitable values of the initial bubble radius and the normalized standoff distance. As the initial bubble radius and the normalized standoff distance increase or decrease from the optimal values, the time of the bubble collapse increases, and the first liquid jet’s speed decreases substantially, whereas the speeds of the second and third liquid jets exhibit no substantial changes. These results on bubble dynamics in an ultrasonic field are important for identifying or correcting the mechanisms of acoustic cavitation and for facilitating its optimization and application.},

	abstract = {In the present paper, the collapsing dynamics of a laser-induced cavitation bubble near the edge of a rigid wall is experimentally investigated with a high-speed photography system. For a symmetrical setup, the two primary control parameters of the bubble collapsing behavior include the equivalent maximum bubble radius and the distance between the bubble and the edge of the rigid wall. Based on the bubble interface deformation during the collapsing process, three typical cases are identified for the categorization of the phenomenon with the influences of the parameters revealed. Through a quantitative analysis of the obtained high-speed photos, the motions of the bubble interface in different directions are given together with the calculations of the bubble centroid. The primary findings of the present paper could be summarized in terms of the bubble-edge distance as follows. When the bubble is close to the edge, the movement of the bubble interface near the edge will be restricted with a clear neck formation in the middle part of the bubble. For this case, the edge could delay the bubble collapsing time up to 22\% of the Rayleigh collapsing time. When the bubble is of the medium distance to the edge, the differences of the expansion or shrinkage of the bubble interface among different directions will be reduced with an olive-shaped bubble formed during the collapsing process. For this range of parameters, the bubble moves rapidly toward the edge especially during the final collapsing stage. When the bubble is far away from the edge, the bubble will be a nearly spherical one.},

	abstract = {Laser ablation in liquids is growing in popularity for various applications including nanoparticle production, breakdown spectroscopy, and surface functionalization. When laser pulse ablates the solid target submerged in liquid, a cavitation bubble develops. In case of “finite” geometries of ablated solids, liquid dynamical phenomena can occur inside the bubble when the bubble overflows the surface edge. To observe this dynamics, we use diffuse illumination of a flashlamp in combination with a high-speed videography by exposure times down to 250  ns. The developed theoretical modelling and its comparison with the experimental observations clearly prove that this approach widens the observable area inside the bubble. We thereby use it to study the dynamics of laser-induced cavitation bubble during its expansion over a sharp-edge (“cliff-like” 90°) geometry submerged in water, ethanol, and polyethylene glycol 300. The samples are 17  mm wide stainless steel plates with thickness in the range of 0.025–2  mm. Bubbles are induced on the samples by 1064-nm laser pulses with pulse durations of 7–60  ns and pulse energies of 10–55  mJ. We observe formation of a fixed-type secondary cavity behind the edge where low-pressure area develops due to bubble-driven flow of the liquid. This occurs when the velocity of liquid overflow exceeds {\textasciitilde}20  m s−1. A re-entrant liquid injection with up to {\textasciitilde}40  m s−1 velocity may occur inside the bubble when the bubble overflows the edge of the sample. Formation and characteristics of the jet evidently depend on the relation between the breakdown-edge offset and the bubble energy, as well as the properties of the surrounding liquid. Higher viscosity of the liquid prevents the generation of the jet.},

The shock wave propagation, reflection from the concave surface and its scattering on the dominant cavity is clearly resolvable on the shadowgraphs. The schlieren approach revealed the pressure build up in the last stage of the collapse and the first stage of the rebound. A persistent low-density watermark is left behind the first collapse.

	abstract = {A model for a nonspherical bubble in a compressible liquid under the coupling effect of ultrasound and electrostatic field was developed in this study. The following assumptions are made: (1) the bubble undergoes adiabatic oscillation; (2) the gravity of the liquid is negligible; (3) the bubble is insulating. If the speed of sound approaches infinity (c→∞), the equation set is reduced to the equation set for an incompressible liquid. We found that, under ultrasonic irradiation coupled with electric stress, a nonspherical bubble cannot oscillate steadily in the liquid. The bubble is bound to collapse during several cycles. The presence of electric stress reduces the surface tension at the bubble wall, which produces a larger maximum bubble-radius during the rarefaction cycle and a smaller minimum bubble-radius during the compression cycle. Consequently, during the collapse, both the gas pressure and the temperature in the bubble center increase substantially, if the bubble is exposed to both ultrasound and electrostatic field instead of ultrasound alone. In addition, the cavitation threshold of the bubble within an electrostatic field decreases significantly, compared to the bubble without an electrostatic field. In general, bubble cavitation occurs more easily and violently in the liquid after the introduction of an electrostatic field.},

	abstract = {The removal of the adsorbed oil droplet is critical to deoiling treatment of oil-bearing solid waste. Ultrasonic cavitation is regarded as an extremely useful method to assist the oil droplets desorption in the deoiling treatment. In this paper, the effects of cavitation micro-jets on the oil droplets desorption were studied. The adsorbed states of oil droplets in the oil-contaminated sand were investigated using a microscope. Three representative absorbed states of the oil droplets can be summarized as: (1) the individual oil droplet adsorbed on the particle surface (2) the clustered oil droplets adsorbed on the particle surface; (3) the oil droplet adsorbed in a gap between particles. The micro-jet generation during the bubble collapse near a rigid wall under different acoustic pressure amplitudes at an ultrasonic frequency of 20 kHz was investigated numerically. The desorption processes of the oil droplets at the three representative absorbed states under micro-jets were also simulated subsequently. The results showed that the acoustic pressure has a great influence on the velocity of micro-jet, and the initial diameter of cavitation bubbles is significant for the cross-sectional area of micro-jets. The wall jet caused by a micro-jet impacting on the solid wall is the most important factor for the removal of the absorbed oil droplets. The oil droplet is broken by the jet impinging, and then it breaks away from the solid wall due to the shear force generated by the wall jet. In addition to a higher sound pressure, the cavitation bubble at a larger initial diameter is more important for the desorption of the clustered oil droplets. Conversely, the micro-jet generated by the cavitation bubble at a smaller initial diameter (0.1 mm) is more appropriate for the desorption of the oil droplet in a narrow or sharp-angled gap.},

Here, the growth process of a gas nucleus in a micro-cavity was simplified to two “events”, and the full confinement effect of the surrounding medium of the cavity was considered by including the bulk modulus in the equation of state. The Rayleigh–Plesset-like equation of the cavitation bubble in the cavity was derived to model the radial oscillation and translational motion of the cavitation bubble in the local acoustic field. The numerical results show that the nucleation time of the cavitation bubble is sensitive to the initial position of the gas nucleus. The cavity size affects the duration of the radial oscillation of the cavitation bubble, where the duration is shorter for smaller cavities. The equilibrium radius of a cavitation bubble grown from a gas nucleus increases with increasing size of the cavity. There are two possible types of translational motion: reciprocal motion around the center of the cavity and motion toward the cavity wall. The growth process of gas nuclei into cavitation bubbles is also dependent on the compressibility of the surrounding medium and the magnitude of the negative pressure. Therefore, gas nuclei in a liquid cavity can be excited by acoustic waves to form cavitation bubbles, and the translational motion of the cavitation bubbles can be easily observed owing to the confining influence of the medium outside the cavity.},

Therefore, it is desirable to develop new strategies to obtain new formulations faster and with less reagent consumption. Here, we present a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic device that generates oil-in-water or water-in-oil mini-emulsions in continuous flow employing ultrasound as the driving force. A Langevin piezoelectric attached to the same glass slide as the microdevice provides enough power to create mini-emulsions in a single cycle and without reagents pre-homogenization. By introducing independently four different fluids into the microfluidic platform, it is possible to gradually modify the composition of oil, water and two different surfactants, to determine the most favorable formulation for minimizing droplet diameter and polydispersity, employing less than 500 µL of reagents. It was found that cavitation bubbles are the most important mechanism underlying emulsions formation in the microchannels and that degassing of the aqueous phase before its introduction to the device can be an important factor for reduction of droplet polydispersity. This idea is demonstrated by synthetizing solid polymeric particles with a narrow size distribution starting from a mini-emulsion produced by the device.},

The jet impacts the solid boundary at a high velocity, and this effect has been taken advantage of in industrial cleaning such as when tiny bubbles are driven ultrasonically to cavitate around machined parts to produce jets that are believed to induce the cleaning effect. In this experimental investigation, we are interested in the jetting from single cavities near a boundary. By introducing a through hole in the boundary beneath a laser-induced bubble, it is hypothesized that the forming jet, upon bubble implosion, will proceed to penetrate through the hole to the other side and that it may be utilized in useful applications such as precise surgeries. It was found that the growth of the bubble induced a fast flow through the hole and lead to the formation of secondary hydrodynamic cavitation. The experiments also showed the formation of a counter jet directed away from the hole and into the bubble. During the growth phase of the bubble, and near the point of maximum expansion, the bubble wall bulged out toward the hole in a ‘bulb’ like formation, which sometimes resulted in the pinching-off of a secondary small bubble. This was ensued by the inward recoiling of the primary bubble wall near the pinch-off spot, which developed into a counter jet seen to move away from the hole and inward into the bubble.},

A grid convergence study and validation of the employed axisymmetric numerical model against the Gilmore’s equation is performed for a case of a single microbubble collapse due to a sudden ambient pressure increase. Numerical simulations of bubble-sphere interaction corresponding to different values of nondimensional bubble-sphere standoff distance δ and their size ratio ε are carried out. The obtained results show vastly different bubble collapse dynamics across the considered parameter space, from the development of a fast thin annular jet towards the sphere to an almost spherical bubble collapse. Although some similarities in bubble shape progression to previous studies on larger bubbles exist, it can be noticed that bubble jetting is much less likely to occur on the considered scale due to the cushioning effects of surface tension on the intensity of the collapse. Overall, the results show that the mechanical loads on a spherical particle tend to increase with a sphere-bubble size ratio ε, and decrease with their distance δ. Additionally, the results are discussed with respect to bacteria eradication by hydrodynamic cavitation. Potentially harmful mechanical effects of bubble-sphere interaction on a micro scale are identified, namely the collapse-induced shear loads with peaks of a few megapascals and propagation of bubble emitted shock waves, which could cause spatially highly variable compressive loads with peaks of a few hundred megapascals and gradients of 100 MPa/μm.},

We study the dynamics of a cavitation bubble near beds of sand of different grain sizes. We use high-speed imaging to observe the motion of the bubble and the sand for different values of the stand-off parameter γγ{\textbackslash}gamma (dimensionless bubble-boundary distance) between 0.3 and 5.3. Compared with a rigid boundary, we find that a granular boundary leads to bubbles with shorter lifetimes and reduced centroid displacements. Above γ≈1.3γ≈1.3{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}approx 1.3, the behaviour of the bubble is almost independent of the granularity of the sand. When the stand-off parameter lies between 0.60.60.6 and 1.31.31.3, a mound of sand develops beneath the bubble, which can force the latter to assume a conical shape as it collapses. For γ≲0.6γ≲0.6{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.6, the bubble develops a bell-shaped form, leading to the formation of thin and surprisingly fast micro-jets (vjet{\textgreater}1000ms−1vjet{\textgreater}1000ms−1v\_\{jet\} {\textgreater} 1000{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}). Moreover, between γ≈1.3γ≈1.3{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}approx 1.3 and γ≈0.3γ≈0.3{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}approx 0.3, granular jets erupt from the sand surface following the bubble collapse. We additionally develop a simple numerical model, based on the boundary integral method, to predict the dynamics of a cavitation bubble near a bed of sand, which we replace by an equivalent liquid. The simulations are remarkably consistent with experimental observations for values of γγ{\textbackslash}gamma down to 1.31.31.3. We also show how the anisotropy parameter ζζ{\textbackslash}zeta, a dimensionless version of the Kelvin impulse, can be adapted for the case of a nearby bed of sand and predict the displacement of the bubble centroid for ζ≲0.08ζ≲0.08{\textbackslash}zeta {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.08.},

	abstract = {Micro/nano bubble formation on the surface of laser-irradiated nanoparticles has been widely studied in various industrial applications. The elucidation of the mechanism underlying cavitation induced by irradiating nanoparticles with laser is imperative. In this work, high-speed digital holographic microscopy is applied to visualize the in-situ dynamics of laser-induced bubbles generated on nanoparticles randomly dispersed in liquids. The growth and collapse of a bubble along its 3D trajectory are quantified. Experimental results show two patterns of bubble formation. One is that the maximum bubble wall speeds occur during either expansion or contraction. The other is that the maximum speeds are similar in both periods. It is found that the durations of growth and collapse are not equal, and their difference increases with the bubble maximum diameter, which is caused by altered heat transfer processes in bubbles. It implies large bubbles expand relatively quickly and shrink relatively slowly. This work will help understand the interaction among laser, nanoparticles and surrounding medium.},

In this work, laser-induced bubble dynamics in SiO2 sand suspension were studied by high-speed imaging. Pulsating characteristics of cavitaiton bubbles in the infinite domain and near a solid boundary were investigated among various laser energies and sand concentrations. Furthermore, the extent of degradation after processing in suspension and the mechanism were analyzed. Results indicate that solid particles in the liquid medium reduce the extent of degradation. However, the extent of degradation may rebound at a proper sand concentration. In addition, compared to several small bubbles in a bubble string (in the infinite domain), a single larger bubble (near a solid boundary) has a much higher degradation ability.},

Firstly, the applicability range of the theoretical model in the time and the space is statistically obtained based on sufficient experimental results. Then, the in-depth theoretical analysis is carried out in terms of the liquid flow field and the bubble Kelvin impulse with the corresponding experimental results as the reasonable support. In addition, the theoretical prediction model of the bubble movement is established and experimentally fitted from the analytic expression of the Kelvin impulse. Through our research, it is found that: (1) the applicability range of the Kelvin impulse theory for the bubble near the spherical particle is approximately the dimensionless distance between the bubble and particle (γ) greater than 0.50. (2) The effect of the particle on the liquid velocity between the bubble and the particle is mainly manifested in the form of the image bubble, which always causes the liquid velocity in this region to be significantly lower than other surrounding regions. (3) The average movement velocity of the bubble centroid can be reasonably predicted by establishing a directly proportional function between the Kelvin impulse and the velocity with the relationship constant (α) equal to 3.57×10−6 ± 1.63×10−7 kg.},

We present an experimental investigation of surface cleaning by gas and vapor bubbles in an ultrasonic field. Using high-speed videography, we found that the primary motions of gas and vapor bubbles responsible for surface cleaning differ. Our cleaning tests under different contamination conditions in terms of contaminant adhesion strength and surface wettability reveal that vapor and gas bubbles are more effective at removing contaminants with strong and weak adhesion, respectively, and furthermore that hydrophobic substrates are better cleaned by vapor bubbles. Our study not only provides a better physical understanding of the ultrasonic cleaning process, but also proposes novel techniques to improve ultrasonic cleaning by selectively employing gas and vapor bubbles depending on the characteristics of the surface to be cleaned.},

The gaseous nature of the nanometric objects was confirmed by a focused acoustic pulse that expands the gas cavities to a size that can be visualized with optical microscopy. The BNBs were produced on demand by a collimated high-energy laser pulse in a “clean” way, meaning that no solid particles or drops were introduced in the sample by the generation method. This is a clear advantage relative to the other standard BNB production techniques. Accordingly, the role of nanometric particles in laser bubble production is discussed. The characteristics of the nanobubbles were evaluated with two alternative methods. The first one measures the response of the BNBs to acoustic pulses of increasing amplitude to estimate their rest radius through the calculation of the dynamics Blake threshold. The second one is based on the bubble dissolution dynamics and the correlation of the bubble’s lifetime with its initial size. The high reproducibility of the present system in combination with automated data acquisition and analysis constitutes a sound tool for studying the effects of the liquid and gas properties on the stability of the BNBs solution.},

A single, laser-induced bubble is generated in an aqueous NaCl solution close to the surface of an aluminum sample. High-speed chronoamperometry is used to record the corrosion current flowing between the sample and an identical aluminum electrode immersed in the same solution. This configuration makes it possible to measure the cavitation damage in the nanometer thin passive layer of the aluminum surface via the corrosion current from the repassivation. Synchronously with the corrosion current, the bubble dynamics is recorded via high-speed imaging. Correlation between the two measurements allows contributing cavitation damage to the respective stages of the bubble dynamics. The largest cavitation-induced currents were observed for the smallest initial bubble-to-surface stand-off distances. As the bubble re-expands and collapses again in several stages, further current peaks were detected implying a sequence of smaller damage. At intermediate stand-offs, the bubble was not damaging and at large stand-off distances, the bubble was only damaging during the second collapse which again occurs at the solid surface.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on using the power of a collapsing bubble in ice breaking. We experimentally validated the possibility and investigated the mechanism of ice breaking with a single collapsing bubble, where the bubble was generated by underwater electric discharge and collapsed at various distances under ice plates with different thicknesses. Characteristics of the ice fracturing, bubble jets and shock waves emitted during the collapse of the bubble were captured. The pattern of the ice fracturing is related to the ice thickness and the bubble–ice distance. Fractures develop from the top of the ice plate, i.e. the ice–air interface, and this is attributed to the tension caused by the reﬂection of the shock waves at the interface. Such fracturing is lessened when the thickness of the ice plate or the bubble–ice distance increases. Fractures may also form from the bottom of the ice plate upon the shock wave incidence when the bubble–ice distance is sufﬁciently small. The ice plate motion and its effect on the bubble behaviour were analysed. The ice plate motion results in higher jet speed and greater elongation of the bubble shape along the vertical direction. It also causes the bubble initiated close to the ice plate to split and emit multiple shock waves at the end of the collapse. The ﬁndings suggest that collapsing bubbles can be used as a brand new way of ice breaking.},

	abstract = {With the collapse of cavitation bubbles near the wall, micro-jets and shock waves will be formed, to generate a high-pressure load and to cause the cavitation damage on the surface of the hydraulic machinery. Due to the rapid development of the cavitation bubble collapse process (in the time scale of hundred nanoseconds), the time resolution of the conventional high-speed cameras should reach more than one million frames per second, which will limit the spatial resolution, and obscure the details of the cavitation bubble shape near the cavitation bubble collapse moment. In this paper, with the help of the laser cavitation bubble photogrammetry system with nanosecond-micron space-time resolution, the experiment is carried out for the cavitation bubble collapse morphology evolution near the wall. The morphological characteristics of the cavitation bubble collapse at specific times are analyzed. With the help of the OpenFOAM code, the collapse process of the cavitation bubble near the solid wall is calculated. It is shown that the cavitation bubble near the wall collapses in an axial symmetric heart shape and the micro-jet directed to the wall will pull the cavitation bubble towards the wall. The counter-jet generated in the rebound stage will drive the cavitation bubble to move away from the wall. The numerical simulation of the cavitation bubble shape in the collapse period is well consistent with the experimental results, but the ability to capture the shock wavefront needs to be improved. Under the conditions studied in this paper, the cavitation bubble collapse micro-jet velocity can reach up to a hundred meters per second both in the experiment and the numerical simulation.},

In the present work we conducted a number of experiments where single cavitation bubble dynamics was observed on each side of the oil-water interface. These were accompanied by corresponding simulations. We investigated the details of bubble interface interaction (deformation, penetration). As predicted, by the anisotropy parameter the bubble always jets toward the interface if it grows in the lighter liquid and correspondingly away from the interface if it is initiated inside the denser liquid. We extended the analysis to the relationships of various bubble characteristics and the anisotropy parameter.

LIB plasma image data are collected as a function of repetition rate and laser pulse number, using an intensified CCD camera with sub-nanosecond camera-laser timing. Each pulse induces multiple breakdowns, shockwaves, and macroscopic cavitation bubbles. These effects disappear by the time the next pulse arrives. Even so, we find that the water target retains effects from previous pulses that persist up to roughly a second and that modify subsequent LIB properties including plasma location, spatial extension, and total emission intensity. We quantify the effects by tracking the first moment of the plasma emission intensity, which we call the “center of intensity” (CoI). Three distinct reproducible repetition-rate-dependent phases are identified with repeated pulses. In particular, (1) with initial pulses, emission intensity decreases and the CoI broadens and propagates downstream from the laser focus reaching a maximum axial distance away from the focal point, (2) with additional pulses, the CoI narrows and travels back upstream toward the laser, and (3) with continued pulses, the plasma gains back a portion of the lost intensity and the CoI reaches a steady state position, not at the focal point. Two possible causal effects are highlighted; particle inclusion concentration changes and microbubbles in the laser path.},

We study the interaction between a laser-induced cavitation bubble and a submillimetre-sized water droplet submerged in silicone oil. High-speed imaging reveals the pathways through which droplet fragmentation occurs and three distinct regimes of bubble–droplet interaction are identified: deformation, external emulsification and internal emulsification. We have observed that during the bubble collapse, the droplet elongates towards the bubble, which acts as a flow sink pulling on the droplet. For silicone oils with higher viscosity, the droplet jets into the cavitation bubble and forms a satellite water droplet in the continuous oil phase. In contrast, for lower-viscosity oils, the droplet encapsulates the collapsing bubble as it jets inside and undergoes multiple cycles of expansion and collapse.

The kinematic viscosity of the silicone oil, maximum bubble diameter and centre-to-centre distance between the bubble and the droplet are varied.

	abstract = {In this study, the impacts of different ultrasonic treatments on TiO2 particles were determined and they were used to manufacture the photoelectrodes of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Two methods were used to prepare TiO2 particles directly sonicated by an ultrasonic horn, and TiO2 treated indirectly by an ultrasonic cleaner. TEM, XPS analysis was confirmed that cavitation bubbles generated during ultrasonication resulted in defects on the surface of TiO2 particles, and the defect induced surface activation. To understand the effect of TiO2 surface activation on energy conversion efficiency of DSSC, ultrasonic horn DSSC and ultrasonic cleaner DSSC were prepared. The UV–vis analysis exhibited that the ultrasonic horn DSSC possessed higher dye adsorption when compared to the ultrasonic cleaner DSSC, and the EIS analysis confirmed that the electron mobility was greatly increased in the ultrasonic horn DSSC. The energy conversion efficiency of the ultrasonic horn DSSC was measured to be 3.35\%, which is about 45\% increase in comparison to that of the non-ultrasonic treated DSSC (2.35\%). In addition to this regard, recombination resistance of ultrasonic horn DSSC was calculated to be 450 Ω·cm2, increasing more than two times compared to the non-ultrasonic treated DSSC (200 Ω·cm2). Taken together, these ultrasonic treatments significantly improved the energy conversion efficiency of DSSC, which was not tried in DSSC-related research, and might lead us to develop more efficient practical route in the manufacturing of DSSC.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have already shown that the process of cavitation can be successfully used for water treatment and eradication of bacteria. However, most of the relevant studies are being conducted on a macro scale, so the understanding of the processes at a fundamental level remains poor. In attempt to further elucidate the process of cavitation-assisted water treatment on a scale of a single bubble, the present paper numerically addresses interaction between a collapsing microbubble and a nearby compliant structure, that mechanically and structurally resembles a bacterial cell. A fluid–structure interaction methodology is employed, where compressible multiphase flow is considered and the bacterial cell wall is modeled as a multi-layered shell structure. Simulations are performed for two selected model structures, each resembling the main structural features of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial cell envelopes. The contribution of two independent dimensionless geometric parameters is investigated, namely the bubble-cell distance δ and their size ratio ς. Three characteristic modes of bubble collapse dynamics and four modes of spatiotemporal occurrence of peak local stresses in the bacterial cell membrane are identified throughout the parameter space considered. The former range from the development of a weak and thin jet away from the cell to spherical bubble collapses. The results show that local stresses arising from bubble-induced loads can exceed poration thresholds of cell membranes and that bacterial cell damage could be explained solely by mechanical effects in absence of thermal and chemical ones. Based on this, the damage potential of a single microbubble for bacteria eradication is estimated, showing a higher resistance of the Gram-positive model organism to the nearby bubble collapse. Microstreaming is identified as the primary mechanical mechanism of bacterial cell damage, which in certain cases may be enhanced by the occurrence of shock waves during bubble collapse. The results are also discussed in the scope of bacteria eradication by cavitation treatment on a macro scale, where processes of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation are being employed.},

	abstract = {To clear the effects of the hydrodynamic interactions among neighboring vapor bubbles on the saturated pool boiling heat transfer, artificial nucleation sites with several cavity arrangements were manufactured on the substrate surface and measured liquid temperatures near heated substrate by a miniature thermocouple probe with 10 kHz. The surface temperature of heated substrate was measured by an infrared camera with 1 kHz and bubble dynamics were simultaneously visualized by a high-speed video camera with 5 kHz and 10 kHz, respectively. The liquid temperature fluctuations, measured with micro thermocouple 100 μm and 10 μm above the substrate surface, were compared among each other and with the transient temperature fields obtained through IR measurements. Results showed that the hydrodynamic interaction among neighboring bubbles causes the liquid convection, that was only detected 100 µm above the boiling surface. Generally, the degree of liquid temperature fluctuations at 10 μm height and different arrangements of nucleation sites was under 1 K. Here the superheated sublayer in the vicinity of the boiling surface was generally not affected by the convection. Only when the coalescence from two neighboring nucleation sites occurred and the liquid-vapor interface nearly reached the substrate, a steep temperature drop over 2 K was detected. It was concluded that the viscous sublayer stably exists during boiling of water in lower heat flux conditions. To enhance the convective heat transfer in nucleate boiling, coalesced bubble needs to peel off the viscous sublayer during its deformation. Based on the measurements in this study, this peel-off effect only happens when the coalescence point is less than 1 mm above the heated surface.},

	abstract = {We experimentally, numerically and theoretically investigate the nonlinear interaction between a cavitation bubble and the interface of two immiscible ﬂuids (oil and water) on multiple time scales. The underwater electric discharge method is utilized to generate a cavitation bubble near or at the interface. Both the bubble dynamics on a short time scale and the interface evolution on a much longer time scale are recorded via high-speed photography. Two mechanisms are found to contribute to the ﬂuid mixing in our system. First, when a bubble is initiated in the oil phase or at the interface, an inertia-dominated high-speed liquid jet generated from the collapsing bubble penetrates the water–oil interface, and consequently transports ﬁne oil droplets into the water. The critical standoff parameter for jet penetration is found to be highly dependent on the density ratio of the two ﬂuids. Furthermore, the pinch-off of an interface jet produced long after the bubble dynamics stage is reckoned as the second mechanism, carrying water droplets into the oil bulk. The dependence of the bubble jetting behaviours and interface jet dynamics on the governing parameters is systematically studied via experiments and boundary integral simulations. Particularly, we quantitatively demonstrate the respective roles of surface tension and viscosity in interface jet dynamics. As for a bubble initiated at the interface, an extended Rayleigh–Plesset model is proposed that well predicts the asymmetric dynamics of the bubble, which accounts for a faster contraction of the bubble top and a downward liquid jet.},

We demonstrate that the density of bubbles formed at graphene-ReS2 interfaces can be controllably reduced using this method.

Breakdown in water and both polymer solutions generated a purely compressive pressure wave. The maximum amplitude and the duration of the breakdown shock wave as well as the maximum bubble radius were not aﬀected by the polymer additives. The notable inﬂuence of the polymer additives was found during the collapse phase of the bubble and is manifested by a prolongation of the oscillation time of the bubble and a reduction of the maximum pressure of the shock wave emitted during bubble collapse. A sizeable attenuation of the bubble collapse was found in the elastic polyacrylamide solution. The present results are consistent with an interpretation which invokes the eﬀect of enhanced levels of uniaxial extensional viscosity on the collapse of micrometer-sized cavitation bubbles.

This superiority is known to be attributed to directional transport of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, we show that in addition to this intrinsic charge transport property, a 1D arrayed structure introduces nanoscale capillary wetting, which is also believed to contribute to the improved PEC performance. Our theoretical model predicts that this morphology-dependent capillarity leads to the formation of a liquid ﬁlm between the photoelectrode surface and the adhered bubble (the generated H2/O2 bubble), thus largely reducing the blockage of active sites at the bubble base. This prediction has been experimentally demonstrated by taking arrayed TiO2 nanorods as a model photoelectrode, with the observation of the PEC activity within the bubble base. This work extends our knowledge toward hydrodynamic functionality involved in morphology-controlled photoelectrodes for enhanced PEC performance.},

To this end, we here propose a new type of energy harvesting strategy in which an optothermally pulsating microbubble is submerged in an underwater medium. The pulsating microbubble gives rise to the periodic vibration of piezocantilevers in contact, which resultantly can produce electrical outputs. On the basis of this simple idea, mechanical power can be extracted from light energy through optothermally pulsating microbubbles in an aqueous medium and subsequently the mechanical power can be converted to electrical power for wireless devices. To elucidate physical factors affecting the performance of the proposed strategy, we thoroughly explore the effect of the intensity and frequency of the laser beam on the pulsation amplitude of optothermally pulsating bubbles and subsequent electrical outputs (e.g., electrical voltage and power). The dependence of electrical output on wetting property of piezocantilevers and electrical resistance is also established. The present work would provide a new framework for fundamental design of bubble-based microactuators as energy harvesters and microsensors in the near future.},

In this study, we developed a ﬁnite-element model to describe the oscillation of nonspherical biosynthetic bubbles composed of a gas core encapsulated in a protein shell. In this model, the elastic properties of the bubble shells were characterized in terms of the density, thickness, Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio. Theoretical calculations were performed for a single bubble and an assembly of randomly oriented bubbles. Our results demonstrate that (1) there are many types of surface oscillation modes for nonspherical biosynthetic bubbles, and a systematic relationship exists between the surface modes and the resonance frequencies; (2) the bubble shell shape has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the acoustic behavior; (3) the resonance frequency of an ellipsoidal bubble decreases with the decrease in its polar radius-to-equatorial axis ratio; and (4) the acoustic scattering of a randomly oriented suspension is isotropic at and below the ﬁrst resonance frequency. Our ﬁndings provide physical insight into the biomedical applications of biosynthetic bubbles and can be used to optimize the acoustics properties of such bubbles.},

We found that the bubble nucleation temperature depends on the gas concentration: the higher the gas concentration, the lower the bubble nucleation temperature. Also, the long-term diﬀusiondominated bubble growth is governed by the gas concentration. The radius of the bubbles grows as R(t) ∝ t1/3 for airequilibrated and air-oversaturated water.

	abstract = {The interaction of an oscillating bubble and a nearby liquid–liquid interface is a complex multiphase problem that has many potential applications. In this work, the behavior of a bubble initially between two different liquids (i.e., with a stand-off distance of zero) is investigated numerically and is shown to exhibit a high degree of nonlinearity. A numerical model based on an Eulerian finite-element method is established. It is validated by simulating a nonspherical collapse of a bubble in the gravity field and comparing the results with those obtained in the experiment. Then, several cases of interaction between an oscillating bubble and a liquid–liquid interface are simulated with different initial conditions. It is confirmed that the density interface tends to induce the bubble to develop a jet that drills into the heavier liquid during the bubble collapse phase. The nondimensional period of oscillation increases with increasing density ratio of the two liquids, and an annular jet impacts, generating a pressure peak, when the density ratio exceeds 1.5. When the effect of gravity is taken into account, it is found that the annular impact is enhanced while the downward jet is weakened. In addition, a significantly sized bubble is split from the main bubble by the impact of the annular jet. When the buoyancy parameter exceeds a threshold value, gravity comes to dominate the bubble motion, and neither an annular jet nor a downward jet will develop. If the buoyancy parameter is large enough, the bubble migrates upward and detaches from the liquid–liquid interface during the collapse phase.},

	abstract = {Cavitation is a very important hydrodynamic phenomenon in many scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds, such as acoustics, medicine, and hydraulics. The relationship between the physical characteristics of liquid media and the erosion status of materials in a cavitation ﬁeld is a crucial concern for many researchers. In this study, we adopted underwater low-voltage discharge technology to generate cavitation bubbles. We studied the eﬀect of the viscosity of liquid media on cavitation bubble dynamics at the mesoscale level by using high-speed photography and a transient stress test system to illustrate the mechanism and the characteristics of material erosion under viscosity changes at the macroscopic level. It was found that high liquid viscosity delays shrinkage of the cavitation bubble and increases the minimum volume to which the cavitation bubble shrinks. The shrinkage characteristics of a cavitation bubble in a solution with high viscosity can reduce the speed of micro-jet formation during the collapse of the cavitation bubble near a wall. In addition, they can delay the impact of the micro-jet on the wall surface and reduce the impact strength when the cavitation bubble collapses. The eﬀect of viscosity on cavitation bubble dynamics at the mesoscale level can explain the erosion law of solid-wall surfaces in a cavitation ﬁeld from a mechanical point of view. These conclusions present signiﬁcant potential for cavitation application and prevention in the ﬁelds of ultrasonic cleaning, medicine, and hydraulic machinery.},

	abstract = {Microbubbles have potential for applications as drug and gene delivery systems, in which the release of a substance is triggered by an ultrasonic pulse. In this paper, we discuss the adsorption and desorption of a ﬁlm of phospholipid on the surface of a single microbubble under ultrasound irradiation. Our optical observation system consisted of a high-speed camera, a laser Doppler vibrometer, and an ultrasound cell; 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) was used as the surfactant. The adsorption of the DMPC molecules onto the surface of the bubble was evaluated by measuring the contact angle between the bubble and a glass plate. A decrease of the contact angle of the bubble indicates desorption of the DMPC molecules from the bubble surface into the surrounding aqueous solution. The amount of DMPC molecules adsorbed on the bubble’s surface is shown to decrease over time after bubble generation. The type and intensity of the pulsed ultrasound waves were varied so as to mimic ultrasound-triggered drug release. Increasing the number of cycles and the amplitude of the sound pressure of the pulsed ultrasound yielded a greater increase of the contact angle. We also measured the radial vibrations of the microbubbles in the ultrasound ﬁeld. The vibrational characteristics of the microbubbles and the desorption characteristics of the DMPC molecules showed the same variation; namely, a greater sound pressure amplitude induced greater vibrational displacement and a larger amount of molecular desorption under resonance conditions. These results support the possibility of controlling drug release with pulsed ultrasound in a microbubble-based drug delivery system.},

In this study, we numerically studied the eﬀects of equilibrium radius and initial void fraction on multiple-bubble behavior and induced pressure. We analyzed the nonspherical collapse, coalescence, and breakup of bubbles in a megasonic ﬁeld using a compressible, locally homogeneous model of a gas-liquid two-phase medium. Bubbles were simulated with a uniform equilibrium radius or with a bubble size distribution. Our results indicate that the bubble behavior and induced pressure depended mainly on the initial void fraction. For the case of bubbles with uniform equilibrium radius, small bubbles generated high wall pressure at large initial void fractions. When there was a size distribution, bubbles with small equilibrium radii contributed little to the wall pressure because of the damping eﬀect of the oscillation of larger bubbles. Furthermore, the addition of a large bubble suppressed the resonant behavior of the bubbles that induced high wall pressure.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the counterjet dynamics generated during the bubble rebound stage near a rigid boundary via both experimental and numerical methods. In the experiments, the temporal evolution of the bubble shapes and the formation of the counterjet are recorded by the high-speed camera. The results are presented for a single bubble generated near different normalized standoff distances γ = L/Rm from 0.5 to 3, where L is the distance between bubble center and boundary, and Rm is the maximum radius of bubble. In order to account for the generation mechanism of counterjet, a 3D weakly compressible model with reformulated mass conservation equation is proposed to predict the transient process of the single bubble patterns and its surrounding flow structure, including the velocity and pressure dynamics and the pressure waves around the bubbles. The results show that the counterjet, the fluid structure opposite to the high-speed jet in the propagation direction, forms during the rebound stage when 1 {\textless} γ {\textless} 3, and the maximum height of the counterjet increases first and then decreases with the increase of γ. Furthermore, the numerical results show that the generation of counterjet is related to the shock wave induced by bubble collapse. The tension wave causes a lowpressure region at the top of the stagnation ring, which is easy to generate the cavitation bubble. And those cavitation bubbles move upwards along the flow streaming generated inside the stagnation ring, which results in the counterjet.},

Superb control of the volume, uniformity, and generation rate of droplets and bubbles arises from unique features of the microscale behavior of ﬂuid interfaces. Fluid interfaces conﬁned within microﬂuidic channels behave quite differently than their counterparts in unbounded ﬂows. Conﬁnement inhibits capillary instabilities so that breakup occurs by largely quasi-static mechanisms. The three-dimensional ﬂow near conﬁned interfaces in rectangular geometries and feedback effects from resistance changes in the entire microﬂuidic network play important roles in regulating the interfacial deformation. Timescales for transport of surfactants and particles to interfaces compete with ﬂow timescales at the microscale, providing further opportunity for tuning the interfacial coverage and properties of individual droplets and bubbles.},

At the moment of the container impact, the free-surface meniscus experiences large radial pressure gradients forming a high-velocity surface jet. We report experimental results and scaling analysis of the jet formation, showing that the jet initiation could also occur during the sudden deceleration phase. We show that the jet velocity scales as the geometric mean of the impact velocity and curvature-deformation velocity scale. We also report results for a second-jet originating from the tip of the evolving first-jet that resembles the tubular jets observed earlier in liquid entry to a pipe problem (Lorenceau et al. in Phys Fluids 14(6):1985–1992, 2002, Bergmann et al. in J Fluid Mech 600:19–43, 2008). We show that the second-jet follows a capillary velocity scale, unlike the tubular jet. The second-jet is caused by the collapse of an unstable cavity at the first-jet tip. The cavity radius follows an inertia-capillary scaling: \$\$\{r{\textbackslash}sim {\textasciitilde}(t\_s-t){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\}\$\$, where \$\$t\_s-t\$\$is the time to singularity.},

The coupling of axial wave propagation in the fluid to flexural waves in the tube may be characterized by a single parameter that depends only on the tube and fluid material properties and dimensions. Using this parameter as a figure of merit, we discuss the limiting cases of weak and strong coupling between the fluid wave motion and tube structural motion. Examples discussed include detonation and shock waves in gas and liquid-filled tubes of metal, polymers, and composites. The results of experiments on elastic and plastic deformation are presented as well as selected results on fracture and rupture. Detonation in gas-filled tubes usually falls in the weak coupling regime except for very thin tubes or cases of deformation that lead to tube rupture. Impact generated axial waves in liquid-filled tubes can range from weak-to-strong coupling cases depending on the tube wall thickness and material. These cases include the well-known phenomenon of water hammer and we describe the relationship of impact studies to previous work on wave-propagation in water-filled pipes.},

We determined the optical breakdown thresholds and analyzed the plasma length achieved at superthreshold irradiance, The parameter range investigated covers the parameters used for intraocular laser surgery. The experimental results are compared to theoretical models for the calculation of breakdown thresholds and the description of plasma growth for superthreshold breakdown. We found that at λ=1064 nm the measured thresholds for both pulse durations coincide with the calculated thresholds for the generation of seed electrons by multiphoton ionization. The breakdown process is completed by avalanche ionization. The seed electron density required for breakdown is about 4×10/sup 9/ cm for the 6-ns pulses, and 1.4×10/sup 11/ cm/sup -3/ for the 30-ps pulses. No spot size dependence of the irradiance threshold for breakdown was observed. The average threshold is by a factor of 5.9 higher for 30-ps pulses (I/sub th/=4.5×1011 W/cm2) than for 6-ns pulses (Ith=0.76×10/sup 11/ W/cm/sup 2/). At angles below approximately 2°, the threshold is influenced by self-focusing effects. The breakdown thresholds at 532 nm are slightly lower than at 1064 nm. Here, multiphoton ionization contributes considerably to the generation of free electrons throughout the whole process of plasma formation. Our results for plasma formation at superthreshold energies support a "breakdown wave" mechanism of plasma growth. For picosecond pulses, the breakdown threshold can be considered to be time-invariant, but for nanosecond pulses there is probably a decrease of the threshold during the laser pulse which may be due to UV-radiation emitted from plasma created at the beginning of the pulse.},

To this end, a spherical bubble model is applied in statistical fashion. This technique is applied to several experimentally realized bubble structures: streamer filaments, clusters, and a peculiar structure we report here on, the acoustically cavitated jet. It is generated by the sonication of a submerged jet to produce abundant cavitation at low flow velocities.

	abstract = {In liquids, bubbles usually exist in the form of bubble groups. Due to their interaction with other bubbles, the resonance frequency of bubbles decreases. In this paper, the resonance frequency of bubbles in a columnar bubble group is obtained by linear simpliﬁcation of the bubbles’ dynamic equation. The correction coeﬃcient between the resonance frequency of the bubbles in the columnar bubble group and the Minnaert frequency of a single bubble is given. The results show that the resonance frequency of bubbles in the bubble group is aﬀected by many parameters such as the initial radius of bubbles, the number of bubbles in the bubble group, and the distance between bubbles. The initial radius of the bubbles and the distance between bubbles are found to have more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the resonance frequency of the bubbles. When the distance between bubbles increases to 20 times the bubbles’ initial radius, the coupling eﬀect between bubbles can be ignored, and after that the bubbles’ resonance frequency in the bubble group tends to the resonance frequency of a single bubble’s resonance frequency. Fluent software is used to simulate the bubble growth, shrinkage, and collapse of ﬁve and seven bubbles under an ultrasonic ﬁeld. The simulation results show that when the bubble breaks, the two bubbles at the outer ﬁeld ﬁrst begin to break and form a micro-jet along the axis line of the bubbles. Our methods and conclusions will provide a reference for further simulations and indicate the signiﬁcance of the prevention or utilization of cavitation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the enhancement of the velocity of focused liquid jets by surface bubbles preformed on the inner surface of the container. The focused jets are created from the impact on a liquid-filled cylindrical tube at cavitation numbers of 0.37 (strong impact where cavitation is likely to occur on unprocessed surfaces) and 2.1 (weak impact where cavitation does not occur from the impact). The bubbles with a base diameter up to hundreds of micrometers were formed via the process of solvent exchange using air-equilibrated ethanol and water. Our measurements by high-speed imaging show that at both cavitation numbers, the jet velocities with preformed bubbles are significantly higher than those without preformed bubbles. Furthermore, our results show that after the process of solvent exchange, a large number of expanding bubbles are observed at cavitation number of 0.37, indicating that possibly both sub-millimeter and sub-micrometer bubbles on the surface contribute to the jet velocity enhancement. At the cavitation number of 2.1, the surface bubbles are observed to oscillate immediately after the impact. The measurements of the liquid pressure after the impact reveal that at both cavitation numbers, the negative pressure is damped by the preformed surface bubbles, contributing to the increase of the jet velocity. This work sheds light on the crucial role of surface bubbles on the impulsive motion of liquids. Our findings have significant implications for the focusing jet technology, opening the opportunities for jetting fragile samples such as biological samples.},

The cavitation bubble is created by focusing a pulsed laser into these structures filled with a light-absorbing liquid. At the center of a 20 μm thick and 1 mm wide channel, pancake-shaped bubbles expand and collapse radially. The bubble dynamics compares with a two-dimensional Rayleigh model and a planar flow field during the bubble collapse is measured. When the bubble is created close to a wall a liquid jet is focused towards the wall, resembling the jetting phenomenon in axisymmetry. The jet flow creates two counter-rotating vortices which stir the liquid at high velocities. For more complex geometries, e.g., triangle- and square-shaped structures, the number of liquid jets recorded correlates with the number of boundaries close to the bubble.},

	abstract = {Presented here are experiments clarifying how the deformation of cavitation bubbles affects their rebound. Rebound bubbles carry the remaining energy of a bubble following its initial collapse, which dissipates energy mainly through shock waves, jets, and heat. The rebound bubble undergoes its own collapse, generating such violent events anew, which can be even more damaging or effective than at first bubble collapse. However, modeling rebound bubbles is an ongoing challenge because of the lack of knowledge on the exact factors affecting their formation. Here we use single-laser-induced cavitation bubbles and deform them by variable gravity or by a neighboring free surface to quantify the effect of bubble deformation on the rebound bubbles. Within a wide range of deformations, the energy of the rebound bubble follows a logarithmic increase with the bubble's initial dipole deformation, regardless of the origin of this deformation.},

The numerical results are compared with an experiment by Haehn et al [1]. The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability dominates the shock-bubble interaction, and the shock focusing in the heavy bubble induces ignition. By following the initial experimental setup published by Haehn et al [1]. and adopting the axisymmetric assumption, we successfully reproduce most of the flow features observed in the experiment both qualitatively and quantitatively, including the bubble morphology evolution and the corresponding chemiluminescence images. The fuel consumption rate is nonmonotonic because of unsteady flame propagation, and it also depends on interfacial instabilities. The deflagration waves increase transverse bubble diameter, mildly decrease the total vorticity, and promote mixing by more than 150\% because of the thermal effects. The mixing promotion is approximately 88\% related to the diffusivity and 12\% related to other mechanisms after ignition. A new shock focusing mechanism is observed due to the secondary refracted shock. During shock focusing, Mach reflection occurs and transits from the bifurcated type to the single type. This transition causes two ignitions: the first occurs in the spiral hot spot entrained by the jet vortex, and the second arises from the hot spot caused by the triple point collision. After the second ignition, the newborn flame is a deflagration at the beginning but is unstable and tends to transit to a detonation as a consequence of shock-flame interactions. Nevertheless, the deflagration-to-detonation transition fails, and the stable combustion mode is deflagration.},

	abstract = {The interaction of a laser-induced cavitation bubble with an elastic boundary is investigated experimentally by high-speed photography and acoustic measurements. The elastic material consists of a polyacrylamide (PAA) gel whose elastic properties can be controlled by modifying the water content of the sample. The elastic modulus, E , is varied between 0.017 MPa and 2.03 MPa, and the dimensionless bubble–boundary distance, γ, is for each value of E varied between γ = 0 and γ = 2.2. In this parameter space, jetting behaviour, jet velocity, bubble migration and bubble oscillation time are determined. The jetting behaviour varies between liquid jet formation towards or away from the elastic boundary, and formation of an annular jet which results in bubble splitting and the subsequent formation of two very fast axial liquid jets flowing in opposite directions. The liquid jet directed away from the boundary reaches a maximum velocity between 300 ms −1 and 600 ms −1 (depending on the elastic modulus of the sample) while the peak velocity of the jet directed towards the boundary ranges between 400 ms −1 and 800 ms −1 (velocity values averaged over 1 𝜇s). Penetration of the elastic boundary by the liquid jet is observed for PAA samples with an intermediate elastic modulus between 0.12 and 0.4 MPa. In this same range of elastic moduli and for small γ-values, PAA material is ejected into the surrounding liquid due to the elastic rebound of the sample surface that was deformed during bubble expansion and forms a PAA jet upon rebound. For stiffer boundaries, the bubble behaviour is mainly characterized by the formation of an axial liquid jet and bubble migration directed towards the boundary, as if the bubble were adjacent to a rigid wall. For softer samples, the bubble behaviour becomes similar to that in a liquid with infinite extent. During bubble collapse, however, material is torn off the PAA sample when bubbles are produced close to the boundary. We conclude that liquid jet penetration into the boundary, jet-like ejection of boundary material, and tensile-stress-induced deformations of the boundary during bubble collapse are the major mechanisms responsible for cavitation erosion and for cavitation-enhanced ablation of elastic materials as, for example, biological tissues.},

	abstract = {Interactions of a planar shock wave with two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) concave, and 3D convex SF6 cylindrical bubbles surrounded by air are studied both experimentally and numerically. The effects of initial interface curvature on the bubble deformation and wave propagation are highlighted. The cylindrical bubbles are generated by a wire-restriction method based on the soap-film technique, and their shapes are well controlled by adjusting the pressure difference across the interface. The high-speed schlieren results demonstrate that the evolving interfaces develop more symmetrically than previous studies as they are free of holder and fewer disturbance waves are generated. Typical evolution processes of the 2D bubble such as the jet formation and vortex pair formation are clearly captured. Compared with the 2D case, the oppositely (identically) signed principal curvatures of the concave (convex) boundary produce more complicated high pressure fields and 3D additional baroclinic vorticity. For 3D cases, the numerical results show that the wave patterns in the symmetry or boundary slice are distinct from the 2D case owing to the 3D movement of the generated waves, and the jet structure presents an evident three dimensionality. In particular, for the concave bubble, a certain slice between the boundary and symmetry slices presents the fastest-developing jet, while for the convex case the fastest jet emerges at the boundary slice. The upstream interface along the symmetry slice of the concave (convex) bubble moves faster (slower) than that of the 2D case, which is reasonably predicted by a 3D theoretical model.},

By confining the bubble within a narrow gap consisting of two rigid plates the jet speed and direction can be altered and an intriguing competition between viscous forces and inertia is resolved. When the bubble is confined within a viscous droplet jetting is observed too, but created through the spherical Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Stability analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the working mechanism for aqueous liquids as well as for liquid metals. The later droplets are used for extreme UV production in the semiconductor industry.},

	abstract = {We present and analyse a model for the spherical pulsations and translational motions of a pair of interacting gas bubbles in an incompressible liquid. The model is derived rigorously in the context of potential flow theory and contains all terms up to and including fourth order in the inverse separation distance between the bubbles. We use this model to study the cases of both weak and moderate applied acoustic forcing. For weak acoustic forcing, the radial pulsations of the bubbles are weakly coupled, which allows us to obtain a nonlinear time-averaged model for the relative distance between the bubbles. The two parameters of the time-averaged model classify four different dynamical regimes of relative translational motion, two of which correspond to the attraction and repulsion of classical secondary Bjerknes theory. Also predicted is a pattern in which the bubbles exhibit stable, time-periodic translational oscillations along the line connecting their centres, and another pattern in which there is an unstable separation distance such that bubble pairs can either attract or repel each other depending on whether their initial separation distance is smaller or larger than this value. Moreover, it is shown that the full governing equations possess the dynamics predicted by the time-averaged model. We also study the case of moderate-amplitude acoustic forcing, in which the bubble pulsations are more strongly coupled to each other and bubble translation also affects the radial pulsations. Here, radial harmonics and nonlinear phase shifting play a significant role, as bubble pairs near resonances are observed to translate in patterns opposite to those predicted by classical secondary Bjerknes theory. In this work, dynamical systems techniques and the method of averaging are the primary mathematical methods that are employed.},

	abstract = {Interactions between multiple bubbles are a feature of many engineering fields and are applied for military, medical, and energy exploration purposes. The difference in generation time between bubbles has a very significant effect on the subsequent formation of jets between bubbles. In this paper, interactions between three bubbles of approximately the same size arranged linearly and at equal distance from each other in a free field with different delay times are explored for the first time. A resistance wire is detonated by a high-voltage power supply with multiple branches to generate bubbles in the water. The discharge time interval between the different branches of the power supply can be precisely controlled. Using high-speed cameras to observe the interactions of the three bubbles under different time delay combinations, we observe jets of different forms and strengths. The interactions between the bubbles are classified according to the properties of the resulting jets. In addition, it is observed that taking the “piercing jet” generated by the interaction of two bubbles as a reference, a third bubble generated under different time delay combinations can enhance or weaken the jet. When the time interval between two bubbles produces an optimal piercing jet with the fastest propagation speed and the longest propagation distance, the third bubble will not affect or weaken the jet. However, when the time interval between the two bubbles does not produce an optimal jet, a third bubble generated at an appropriate time will help to increase the propagation distance and propagation velocity of the jet. Finally, the widths of the piercing jets generated by bubble coupling and the oscillation periods of the three bubbles are statistically analyzed.},

	abstract = {A detailed experimental study on acoustically induced bubble jets produced far from any solid wall is presented. This particular type of bubble jet is observed when a laser-induced gas cavity is seeded in a liquid by an optical dielectric breakdown while applying a strong ultrasonic field. This generation method allows a high degree of control over jet dynamics, achievable by changing critical experimental parameters such as the laser pulse energy (i.e., the size of the bubbles), the driving signal frequency, the seeding phase (relative to the sound field), the acoustic pressure amplitude, and, in particular, the pressure gradient at the bubble inception location. The temporal evolution of the characteristic dimensions of the bubble jets is analyzed by means of numerical simulations of spherical bubble dynamics and their dependence on the local acoustic field. The jet strength is presented in terms of the jet elongation ratio, defined as the axial length over the maximum width. The most relevant parameters related to the jet strength are the maximum radius reached by the bubble prior to the jet formation and the pressure gradient during the bubble collapse phase. The existence of optimum driving parameters and the bubble seeding position to obtain the strongest jets achievable in a given acoustic pressure distribution is discussed. This study is a first step to shed some light on the jet formation process due to known time-variable pressure gradients. The work can be extended to further understanding the role of bubble jets in sonochemical reactions and biological or medical applications.},

It is shown that, at this order, a one-parameter family of approximate equations for the bubble radius exists, which includes those previously derived by Herring and Keller as special cases. The relative merits of these and other equations of the family are judged by comparison with numerical results obtained from the complete partial-differential-equation formulation by the method of characteristics. It is concluded that an equation close to the Keller form, but written in terms of the enthalpy of the liquid at the bubble wall, rather than the pressure, is most accurate, at least for the cases considered of collapse in a constant-pressure field and collapse driven by a Gaussian pressure pulse. A physical discussion of the magnitude and nature of compressibility effects is also given.},

	abstract = {The inception of cavitation in multibubble cases is studied numerically and theoretically to show that it is different from that in single-bubble cases in several aspects. Using a multibubble model based on the Rayleigh–Plesset equation with an acoustic interaction term, we confirmed that the recently reported suppression of cavitation inception due to the interaction of nonidentical bubbles can take place not only in liquid mercury but also in water, and we found that a relatively large bubble can significantly decrease the cavitation threshold pressure of a nearby small bubble. By examining in detail the transition region where the dynamics of the suppressed bubble changes drastically as the interbubble distance changes, we determined that the explosive expansion of a bubble under negative pressure can be interrupted and turn into collapse even though the far-field liquid pressure well exceeds the bubble’s threshold pressure. Numerical results suggest that the interruption of expansion occurs when the bubble radius is exceeded by the instantaneous unstable equilibrium radius of the bubble determined using the total pressure acting on the bubble. When we extended the discussion to systems of larger numbers of bubbles, we found that a larger number of bubbles have a stronger suppression effect. The present findings would be useful in understanding the complex behavior of cavitation bubbles in practical applications where, in general, many cavitation nuclei exist and may interact with each other.},

	abstract = {The complex mechanism behind the laser-induced cavitation bubble has led to challenges in its modeling. Current models can only predict the radius of the single laser-induced cavitation bubble over one or two growth and collapse cycles. To fill the gap, we propose a new model that takes into account the liquid compressibility, heat transfer, and non-equilibrium evaporation and condensation. Specifically, we use a new approximation of the temperature gradient at the bubble surface. The four unknown physical parameters in the model are found by fitting to the experimentally measured bubble radius. The predicted bubble radius agrees with the experimental measurements within 10\% for several cycles of bubble growth and collapse. The calibrated evaporation coefficient is close to 0.04, which agrees with the value reported in the literature. The maximum potential energy of the bubble is found to have a linear relation with the laser energy. The amount of air is found to be less than 1\% when the bubble reaches maximum. Our model predicts that the maximum temperature occurs during the first collapse, but the maximum pressure and extension rate can occur at the second collapse depending on the evaporation coefficient. Evaporation and condensation are found to have a significant effect on the dynamic behavior of the bubble. Increasing the amount of non-condensable air in the bubble helps mitigate the collapsing process, and thus, decreases the maximum pressure, temperature, and extension rate.},

The physics and chemistry behind the phenomena are simply, but comprehensively presented. In addition, potential industrial and medical applications of acoustic cavitation and its chemical effects are described and reviewed. The book is suitable for graduate students working with ultrasound, and for potential chemists and chemical engineers wanting to understand the basics of how ultrasound acts in a liquid to cause chemical and physical effects.},

	abstract = {近年来,随着激光器技术的不断进步,超短脉冲强激光在介质中的传输、成丝控制以及激光在水下声源中的应用成为领域内的一个研究热点。本文在此基础上,开展超短脉冲强激光传输、成丝控制及激光水下声源应用的研究。本文首先研究了超短脉冲强激光在传输介质中传输时所引起的散射、空间-时间散焦、群速度色散、高阶色散、克尔自聚焦、自相位调制、拉曼效应、多光子电离等效应,对超短脉冲强激光在传输介质中的传播过程进行了全面的描述。本文还分析了等离子体与激光的相互作用过程,并综合超短脉冲强激光在传输介质中传输时的各种效应,给出了具体的数学模型。随后,本文采用数值仿真计算的方法,对超短脉冲强激光在传输介质中的传输过程进行了二维和三维仿真。在二维仿真中,研究了激光峰值功率、脉冲形状、激光波长、脉宽等因素对激光传输、成丝及产生的电离通道的影响。仿真结果表明,激光峰值功率越高,越有利于形成连续的电离通道；采用贝塞尔形激光脉冲,其产生的电离通道宽度更窄、长度更长、电子密度分布更均匀。改变激光波长为248nm的紫外激光,其产生的电子密度数量级保持不变,而相应的峰值功率密度减小两个数量级。保持激光其它参数不变,增大脉宽将使电离通道中的电子密度分布更均匀。在三维仿真中,研究了椭圆形激光脉冲、圆环形激光脉冲、黑色薄片、幅度盘及相位盘等手段对多丝分布的影响。结果表明,初始激光脉冲形状为椭圆形时,丝沿椭圆长轴方向分布,而在椭圆短轴方向上,丝分布区域被压缩。当初始激光脉冲形状为圆环形时,丝沿圆环轴线排列,从而在空间上形成一管道形电离通道。采用黑色薄片,对激光进行裁切,当激光脉冲被裁切为一维直线形、正方形及椭圆形时,相应形成的多丝也分别排列成直线形、正方形及椭圆形形状。通过采用幅度盘,可对丝的数量进行精确控制,此时,丝排列成规则的几何形状。改用相位盘,丝沿相位改变极大值方向进行排列。针对激光在水下声源的应用,本文分别研究了热膨胀机制、汽化机制及击穿机制下激光声源的波形、频谱、指向性等特性。本文还研究了双空泡情况下,激光致空化气泡溃灭及其产生的声波辐射。研究结果表明,通过控制激光光强的时域波形、光斑形状、激光串波形形状、重复频率等参数,可有效控制激光水下声源的时域波形、频谱及指向性。汽化机制下,激光声源产生声波的时域波形、频谱及指向性等随观测点位置、观测频率、光斑位置等不同而不同。击穿机制下,通过建立等离子体柱模型与等离子体椭球模型,研究了两种情况下声波的指向特性。此外,在激光致单空泡运动及其辐射声波的基础上,研究了双空泡运动情况下,空泡运动及其辐射声波。研究发现,空泡间距越小,空泡溃灭时达到的最小半径越小,辐射产生的声压越高。最后,本文设计实验,研究了激光水下声源的时域、频谱特性,并分别研究了水下声源辐射声压级与激光能量、水体盐度、颗粒物浓度、聚焦点位置等因素的关系。实验结果表明,激光能量越高,激光产生的声压级越高,两者近似成2次方关系；随水体盐度增加,激光声源辐射声压级呈上升趋势。当观测点位置一定时,聚焦点位置离水面越近,激光致声源辐射声波的声压级越高。激光声源辐射声压随颗粒物浓度的升高并没有明显的上升或下降趋势。预测结果表明,在浑浊海水中,随传输距离增加,激光声源辐射声波的时域波形中的高频振荡部分消失,脉宽展宽,频谱中的高频部分迅速衰减,直至消失。考虑沙质海底影响后,垂直入射时,激光水下声源辐射声波的时域波形、频谱分布并没有发生太大变化,然而其幅度变得更小。},

Our goal is to characterize these fundamental properties, which are critical to the understanding of retinal and other ophthalmic damage produced by ultrashort laser pulses. Laser pulses of 5.0 nanoseconds (ns) at less than 5.0 milli-Joules (mJ) per pulse and pulses of 80 picoseconds (ps) at 0.5 to 1 .5 mJ per pulse from a Nd:YAG regenerative amplifier were used to produce LIB in a variety of aqueous media. These include physiological saline solution, triple-distilled water, and tap water. The resulting luminescent plasmas were analyzed using integrated light spectroscopy from a Chromex 0.25 meter (m) spectrograph. Plasmas were recorded in the wavelength region from 300 to 900 nm. Each spectrum obtained was analyzed using a Planck distribution for blackbody emission. The surface temperatures of the plasmas for the two pulse durations were computed to be in the 5000 K to 10,000 K range, depending on the pulse duration and energy. Also, the spectrographs from the saline solution included distinct spectral lines of emission over the broad band spectra, such as the 589 nm atomic emission line of sodium. We will discuss the time-integrated spectroscopy of LIB in the various solutions, and how LIB might mediate retinal damage induced by ultrashort laser pulses.},

	abstract = {This book, as a volume of the Shock Wave Science and Technology Reference Library, is primarily concerned with the fundamental theory of detonation physics in gaseous and condensed phase reactive media. The detonation process involves complex chemical reaction and fluid dynamics, accompanied by intricate effects of heat, light, electricity and magnetism - a contemporary research field that has found wide applications in propulsion and power, hazard prevention as well as military engineering. The seven extensive chapters contained in this volume are: - Chemical Equilibrium Detonation (S Bastea and LE Fried) - Steady One-Dimensional Detonations (A Higgins) - Detonation Instability (HD Ng and F Zhang) - Dynamic Parameters of Detonation (AA Vasiliev) - Multi-Scaled Cellular Detonation (D Desbordes and HN Presles) - Condensed Matter Detonation: Theory and Practice (C Tarver) - Theory of Detonation Shock Dynamics (JB Bdzil and DS Stewart) The chapters are thematically interrelated in a systematic descriptive approach, though, each chapter is self-contained and can be read independently from the others. It offers a timely reference of theoretical detonation physics for graduate students as well as professional scientists and engineers.},

If the jet static pressure is sufficiently low, vaporous cavitation can occur in, or perhaps slightly upstream of, the nozzle exit. On the other hand, even if the jet static pressure is not low, the fluctuating stresses in the highly turbulent shear layer of the jet may induce cavitation. Although the second of these is not so straightforward as the first, it is perhaps of more general interest and importance, and is the problem to which the present paper is directed. (microfiche)},

	abstract = {The ability of ultrasound to produce highly controlled tissue erosion was investigated. This study is motivated by the need to develop a noninvasive procedure to perforate the neonatal atrial septum as the first step in treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. A total of 232 holes were generated in 40 pieces of excised porcine atrial wall by a 788 kHz single-element transducer. The effects of various parameters [e.g., pulse repetition frequency (PRF), pulse duration (PD), and gas content of liquid] on the erosion rate and energy efficiency were explored. An Isppa of 9000 W/cm2, PDs of 3, 6, 12, and 24 cycles; PRFs between 1.34 kHz and 66.7 kHz; and gas saturation of 40–55\% and 79–85\% were used. The results show that very short pulses delivered at certain PRFs could maximize the erosion rate and energy efficiency. We show that well-defined perforations can be precisely located in the atrial wall through the controlled ultrasound tissue erosion (CUTE) process. A preliminary in vivo experiment was conducted on a canine subject, and the atrial septum was perforated using CUTE.},

In this review, authors restrict their discussion to attempts to understand the fundamental mechanisms that may be responsible for cavitation damage. Studies at this level have two principal aims: to determine the flow fields leading to potentially damaging phenomena, and to investigate methods to reduce or even eliminate damage. Authors' review is primarily concerned with experimental and theoretical studies of the growth and collapse of a single vapor bubble near boundaries in the presence of an ambient pressure gradient and a velocity field. The liquid is assumed to be 'cold', with the contents of the bubble consisting of vapor and the fluid mechanics being dominated by inertia. Compressibility effects in both the liquid and vapor are not covered in this review.},

	abstract = {More than a decade has elapsed since the publication of the first edition of this book. During this period the response from readers the world over has been overwhelming, from students and academics to senior researchers. This decade has also witnessed a significant increase in the use of numerical methods, not only in the traditional areas such as physics and industrial processes, but also in biology, economics, social sciences and in inter–disciplinary research areas. We also observe a new trend in mathematical modelling and numerical simulation. Numerical methods are steadily moving from being a simulation tool for engineering design in technology, to being an indispensable instrument in science, for studying and understanding phenomena of the most varied kind. The expectation is that a simulation will represent the solution of the actual mathematical model. Such expectation implies the need for more and more high–quality research on new and more accurate numerical methods and the need for better training of scientists at the undergraduate and post–graduate levels at universities and higher education institutions. I expect that this new edition of the book will continue to play a role in such endeavours. In this edition I have included three new chapters, chapters 18 to 20. Chapter 18 is about a multi–dimensional extension of the centred FORCE flux studied in Chapter 7, for one–dimensional systems; in a sense, this new chapter is a response to the increasing role of the so–called centred methods. These have the advantage of avoiding the direct solution of the classical Riemann problem, in the conventional manner. As a result, the applicability of these centred schemes is more general than that of conventional upwind methods; this feature is specially useful when having to solve complicated systems, for which the solution of the Riemann problem may be difficult or impossible to obtain. The new FORCE scheme applies to two and three space dimensions on general structured and unstructured meshes and can be extended to high order of accuracy in space and time in the frameworks of finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. The second new addition, chapter 19, is about the high–order, or generalized, Riemann problem, the Cauchy problem for hyperbolic balance laws whose initial conditions are two smooth vectors separated by a discontinuity at the origin. The solution of the generalized Riemann problem serves as the building block for constructing fully discrete, one–step Godunov–type schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy in both space and time. This chapter is effectively a generalization of the material of this book studied in previous chapters and responds to the general trend of improving the accuracy, in space and time, of numerical methods for solving evolutionary partial differential equations. These high–order numerical schemes can be constructed in the frameworks of finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. The third new chapter, chapter 20, contains an introduction to these high–order methods in the framework of finite volumes. This edition of the book contains a substantially revised version of the HLLC Riemann solver of chapter 10. This responds to many communications received from readers and to new developments of the technique and its use for very ambitious scientific and technological applications. Some modifications to chapter 21 have also been carried out, as well general corrections to errors pointed out by readers. This book, in spite of being introductory in nature, continues to be a book used mainly by researchers, and is perhaps too advanced for teaching undergraduate students. As a result, a new more elementary book is being written in collaboration with Enrico Bertolazzi and Gianluca Vignoli. This new book, to be published by Springer in 2009, is specifically designed for teaching undergraduate students in Science and Engineering, with plenty of exercises, case studies and miniprojects. On the other hand, in order to respond to research needs for better and more sophisticated numerical methods, we are currently preparing a new book, in collaboration with Claus–Dieter Munz, Vladimir Titarev and Michael Dumbser. This book will deal with advanced, high–order, finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin numerical methods for structured and unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions, to be published by Springer in 2009. I gratefully acknowledge the contribution of some collaborators to the preparation of this third edition. In particular I thank two of my former PhD students, Dr. Vladimir Titarev, now at Cranfield University, UK and Dr. Crist´obal Castro, now at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. I also thank two former post–doctoral fellows, Dr. Martin K¨aser, now at the Technical University of Munich, Germany and Dr. Michael Dumbser, now a colleague in my group at Trento University, Italy. Thanks are also due to colleague Enrico Bertolazzi and to visiting scholars Mar´ıa Nofuentes (Universidad de C´ordoba, Spain) and Arturo Hidalgo (Universidad Polit´ecnica de Madrid, Spain), who kindly helped in various ways in the preparation of the material.I find it also appropriate to recall that the initial stages in the preparation of the first edition of this book took place at Cranfield University, formerly Cranfield Institute of Techology, United Kingdom. During the late 80s and early 90s, a very dynamic and stimulating group of scientists from various backgrounds, existed in the Aerodynamics Department, within the School of Aerospace Sciences. Those years at Cranfield greatly influenced the contents and scope of this book, for which I thank former senior and junior colleagues and students, John Clarke (FRS), Phil Roe, Jack Pike, Smadar Karni, James Quirk, Nikos Nikiforakis, Stephen Billett, Alan Dowes, Caroline Lowe, William Speares, Michael Spruce, Ed Boden, Mauricio C´aceres, and many others.

Pulsed ultrasound inhibits the generation of large degassing bubbles that restrict the efficient spatial region for sonochemical reaction. The vibration amplitude of the liquid surface becomes gradually significant with pulsed ultrasound as the power applied to the transducer increases. At this time the SCL intensity increases and then decreases after displaying a peak. The SCL intensity during high-amplitude pulsing becomes almost zero if the distance between the highest position of the liquid surface and its position in the absence of ultrasound becomes close to or larger than one quarter of the ultrasound wavelength. This condition for the liquid surface vibration provides a limit for establishment of a resonant standing wave that is effective for sonochemical reaction.

	abstract = {This thesis concerns the dynamics of bubbly flows with a distribution of equilibrium bubble sizes. The main goal is to formulate the physical and numerical models of continuum bubbly flows that enable us to efficiently compute the average mixture dynamics. Numerical simulations are conducted to quantify the effects of bubble size distributions on the averaged dynamics for several model flows.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$r\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$r\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nFirst, the ensemble-averaged conservation laws for polydisperse bubbly flows are derived. One-way-coupled flow computations are conducted to illustrate that the different-sized bubbles can oscillate with different frequencies. The resulting phase cancellations can be regarded as an apparent damping of the averaged dynamics of polydisperse flows. A high-order-accurate finite-volume method is then developed to compute the flow, paying special attention to issues of wave dispersion and stiffness.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$r\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$r\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nNext, computations of one-dimensional shock propagation through bubbly liquids are performed. The numerical experiments reveal that the bubble size distribution has a profound impact on the averaged shock structure. If the distribution is sufficiently broad, the apparent damping due to the phase cancellations can dominate over the single-bubble-dynamic dissipation (due to thermal, viscous, and compressibility effects) and the averaged shock dynamics become insensitive to the individual bubble dynamics. One-dimensional cloud cavitation caused by fluid-structure interaction is also solved to investigate the collapse of cavitation clouds with both monodisperse and polydisperse nuclei. The phase cancellations among the cavitation bubbles with broad nuclei size distributions are found to eliminate violent cloud collapse in the averaged dynamics.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$r\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$r\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nFinally, shock propagation through a bubbly liquid-filled, deformable tube is considered. The quasi-one-dimensional conservation law that takes into account structural deformation is formulated and steady shock relations are derived. The results are compared to water-hammer experiments; the present shock theory gives better agreement with the measured wave speeds than linear theory. This indicates that the gas-phase nonlinearity needs to be included to accurately predict the propagation speeds of finite-amplitude waves in a deformable tube filled with a bubbly liquid.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.2774000},
	abstract = {High-intensity light from a laser pulse can produce optical breakdown in a liquid, followed by a shock wave and the growth of a cavitation bubble. When the bubble reaches its maximum radius the liquid pressure causes it to collapse, which in turn initiates the growth of another bubble. The oscillations can repeat themselves several times, and a shock wave is emitted after every collapse. In our study the breakdown was induced in distilled water by a Nd:YAG pulsed laser, which was designed for ocular photodisruption. The main focus of our experiments was measurement of the cavitation bubble and the shock waves using an optical probe based on deflections of a laser beam. The applied experimental setup made it possible to carry out one- or two-dimensional scanning of the cavitation bubble based on automatic control of the experiment. Since the beam-deflection probe (BDP) allowed simultaneous measurements of the cavitation bubble and the shock waves, we developed a method for reducing the measurement noise of the BDP scanning. This improvement includes an analysis of the secondary shock waves and leads to a significant reduction in the noise of the measurement. Simultaneous measurements based on shadow photography were used as a comparative method during the experiment. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Food safety is essential considering that there are reports of outbreaks involving the consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with pathogens. Washing associated with sanitizer procedure is considered as a critical step to satisfy hygienic and sanitary requirements and maintain the sensory and nutritional characteristics of fruits and vegetables. Chemical compounds are widely applied to clean and sanitize fresh fruits and vegetables, and some of these chemicals, such as the inorganic chlorine compounds, produce by-products that are dangerous to human health. The use of ultrasound is a technology that is gaining ground in the food industry. Ultrasound is a form of energy generated by sound waves at frequencies that are too high to be detected by the human ear. In ultrasound, the removal of dirt and food residues from surfaces and the inactivation of microorganisms occur as a consequence of cavitation, which is the formation, growth and collapse of bubbles that generate a localized mechanical and chemical energy. There are indications that this technology can be used in the food industry, alone or associated with chemical sanitizers. In this paper, we discuss the principles, mechanisms and effects of ultrasound on fruits and vegetables as a sanitization technology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Scaling laws for the maximum bubble radius and the temperature and duration of the collapse are derived in this limit. Inclusion of mass diffusion enables one to calculate the ambient radius. For audible sound fields these equations yield picosecond hot spots, such as are observed experimentally. However, the analysis indicates that a detailed description of sonoluminescence requires the use of parameters for which the resulting motion reaches large Mach numbers. Therefore the next step toward explaining sonoluminescence will require the extension of bubble dynamics to include nonlinear effects such as shock waves. © 1993 American Institute of Physics.},

First, by ensemble averaging, an expression for the average stress tensor is obtained, which is non-isotropic although the local stress tensors in the constituent phases are isotropic (viscosity is neglected). Next, by applying the same technique, the momentum-flux tensor of the entire mixture is obtained. An equation expressing the fact that the average force on a massless bubble is zero leads to a third relation. Complemented with mass-conservation equations for liquid and gas, these equations appear to constitute a completely hyperbolic system, unlike the systems with complex characteristics found previously.

The fluid velocity field in the vicinity of the cavitation bubble is determined with time-resolved particle image velocimetry. A comparison of path lines deduced from successive measurements shows good agreement with the results of numerical calculations by Kucera \& Blake (1988). The pressure amplitude, the profile and the energy of the acoustic transients emitted during spherical bubble collapse and the collapse near a rigid boundary are measured with a hydrophone and an optical detection technique. Sound emission is the main damping mechanism in spherical bubble collapse, whereas it plays a minor part in the damping of aspherical collapse. The duration of the acoustic transients is 20-30 ns. The highest pressure amplitudes at the solid boundary have been found for bubbles attached to the boundary. The pressure inside the bubble and at the boundary reaches about 2.5 kbar when the maximum bubble radius is 3.5 mm. The results are discussed with respect to the mechanism of cavitation erosion.},

The refined model predicts that bubbles with radii smaller than 2 µm will be repelled by large bubbles, in contrast to predictions from previous models. The matching pressure needed to obtain same level of transient cavitation in different Kelvin-Voigt fluids is shown to depend mainly on the shear modulus and is insensitive to other parameters, which makes it a useful parameter to correlate the results. When the radii of the bubbles fall between 4 µm and 6 µm, the secondary Bjerknes force obtained with matching pressures shows only weak dependence on the shear modulus. For the pressure amplitudes investigated, equilibrium distances can be found between two bubbles when the equilibrium radius of one of the bubbles is in a narrow range around 2 μm. The equilibrium distance decreases when the shear modulus is increased. A simple relation between the two quantities is established.},

	abstract = {Shock wave emission from a hemispherical cloud of bubbles, situated in non-Newtonian ﬂuids, is investigated by high-speed photography, with up to 20 million frames/s and an exposure time of 5 ns, and acoustic measurements. The non-Newtonian ﬂuids consist of a 0.5\% polyacrylamide (PAM) aqueous solution, with a strong elastic component, and a 0.5\% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) aqueous solution, with a weak elastic component. In the relatively inelastic CMC solution, the maximum amplitude and the duration of the shock wave emitted during bubble cloud rebound are almost identical to the case of water. A signiﬁcant reduction of the shock wave pressure was found in the elastic PAM solution. This difference ranges from a factor of 2, for a maximum radius of the bubble cloud Rmax \% 800 lm, up to a factor of 3, at Rmax \% 270 lm. A decrease of the shock wave duration was also observed in the elastic PAM solution. The observed reduction is attributed to an increased resistance to extensional ﬂow which is conferred upon the liquid by the polymer additive and to an increase of the cavitation threshold of the liquid. At a maximum radius of about 400 lm, the shock pressure for a bubble cloud, situated in water and 0.5\% CMC solution, is with a factor of six larger than the value measured in the case of individual cavitation bubbles. This difference is smaller in the case of a 0.5\% PAM solution where the shock pressure for a bubble cloud is only three times larger than for a single bubble. The results are discussed with respect to cavitation erosion in polymer solutions and collateral effects in pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound surgery, such as histotripsy used for the destruction of blood clots.},

	abstract = {Shock wave emission and cavitation bubble expansion after optical breakdown in water with Nd:YAG laser pulses of 30-ps and 6-ns duration is investigated for energies between 50 μJ and 10 mJ which are often used for intraocular laser surgery. Time-resolved photography is applied to measure the position of the shock front and the bubble wall as a function of time. The photographs are used to determine the shock front and bubble wall velocity as well as the shock wave pressure as a function of time or position. Calculations of the bubble formation and shock wave emission are perforated using the Gilmore model of cavitation bubble dynamics and the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. The calculations are based on the laser pulse duration, the size of the plasma, and the maximally expanded cavitation bubble, i.e., on easily measurable parameters. They yield the dynamics of the bubble wall, the pressure evolution inside the bubble, and pressure profiles in the surrounding liquid at fixed times after the start of the laser pulse. The results of the calculations agree well with the experimental data. A large percentage of the laser pulse energy (up to 72\%) is transformed into the mechanical energy E(S) and E(B) of the shock wave and cavitation bubble, whereby the partitioning between E(S) and E(B) is approximately equal. 65\%- 85\% of E(S) is dissipated during the first 10 mm of shock wave propagation. The pressure at the plasma rim ranges from 1300 MPa (50 μJ, 30 ps) to 7150 MPa (10 mJ, 6 ns). The calculated initial shock wave duration has values between 20 and 58 ns, the duration measured 10 mm away from the plasma is between 43 and 148 ns. A formation phase of the shock front occurs after the ns pulses, but not after the ps pulses where the shock front exists already 100 ps after the start of the laser pulse. After shock front formation, the pressure decays approximately proportional to r-2, and at pressure values below 100 MPa proportional to r-1.06. The maximum bubble wall velocity ranges from 390 to 2450 m/s. The calculations of bubble and shock wave dynamics can cover a large parameter range and may thus serve as a tool for the optimization of laser parameters in medical laser applications.},

The computations provided a good insight into film boiling yielding quantitative information on unsteady periodic bubble release patterns and on the spatially and temporally varying film thickness.

	abstract = {Rod-shaped cavitation bubble structure in thin liquid layers in ultrasonic ﬁeld is investigated experimentally. It is found that cavitation structure successively experiences several stages with the change of the thickness of the thin liquid layer. Rod-shaped structure is a stable structure of the boundary between the cavitation cloud region and the non-cavitation liquid region, which can be formed in two diﬀerent ways. Cavitation bubbles in a thin liquid layer have a distribution in the thickness direction. The rod-shaped structures tend to crosslink with each other to form stable Y-branch structures. The angle of the Y-branch structure is Gauss distribution with mathematical expectation μ = 119.93. A special rod-shaped cavitation structure with source is also investigated in detail. Due to the pressure gradient in the normal direction, the primary Bjerknes force causes the bubbles in the rod-shaped structure on both sides to converge to the axis. The secondary Bjerknes forces between the bubbles also make the cluster converge, so the large bubbles which are attached to the radiating surface tend to align themselves along the central line. According to the formula deduced in this paper, the variation of curvature of curved rod-shaped structure is qualitatively analyzed. The Y-branch structure of cavitation cloud and Plateau boundary of soap bubbles are compared.},

	abstract = {A high-order accurate shock- and interface-capturing scheme is used to simulate the collapse of a gas bubble in water. In order to better understand the damage caused by collapsing bubbles, the dynamics of the shock-induced and Rayleigh collapse of a bubble near a planar rigid surface and in a free field are analysed. Collapse times, bubble displacements, interfacial velocities and surface pressures are quantified as a function of the pressure ratio driving the collapse and of the initial bubble stand-off distance from the wall; these quantities are compared to the available theory and experiments and show good agreement with the data for both the bubble dynamics and the propagation of the shock emitted upon the collapse. Non-spherical collapse involves the formation of a re-entrant jet directed towards the wall or in the direction of propagation of the incoming shock. In shock-induced collapse, very high jet velocities can be achieved, and the finite time for shock propagation through the bubble may be non-negligible compared to the collapse time for the pressure ratios of interest. Several types of shock waves are generated during the collapse, including precursor and water-hammer shocks that arise from the re-entrant jet formation and its impact upon the distal side of the bubble, respectively. The water-hammer shock can generate very high pressures on the wall, far exceeding those from the incident shock. The potential damage to the neighbouring surface is quantified by measuring the wall pressure. The range of stand-off distances and the surface area for which amplification of the incident shock due to bubble collapse occurs is determined.},

In the present study, numerical analysis of nonspherical bubble collapse behavior and induced impulsive pressure at several initial standoﬀ distance from the wall boundary is performed using a locally homogeneous model of a gasliquid two-phase medium. The second collapse is conﬁrmed to be more violent than the ﬁrst collapse, and a circular erosion pattern is predicted owing to a toroidal bubble collapse attached to the wall boundary at a certain standoﬀ distance. The inﬂuence of the symmetry breaking of the initial spherical bubble shape on the collapse behavior is investigated, and the asymmetry is found to inﬂuence the second bubble collapse, especially the generation of the high impulsive pressure in the central area.},

Bubble dynamics effects and energy dissipation due to viscosity, heat transfer, liquid compressibility and relative motion of the two phases are included. The equations of motion for the average flow and the bubble radius are linearized and a closed-form solution is obtained. The results are then generalized by means of Fourier synthesis to the case of arbitrary far-field pressure excitation. The flow displays various regimes (sub-resonant, trans-resonant and super-resonant) with different properties depending on the value of the relevant flow parameters. Examples are discussed in order to show the effects of the inclusion of the various energy dissipation mechanisms. Finally the results for the case of Gaussian-shaped far-field pressure change are presented and the most important limitations of the theory are briefly discussed. The simple linearized dynamical analysis developed so far clearly demonstrates the importance of the complex phenomena connected to the interaction of the dynamics of the bubbles with the flow and provides an introduction to the more realistic study of the same flows with nonlinear bubble dynamics.},

Physical disruption of biofilms has become an important area of research. In dentistry, biofilm removal is essential to maintain health. The aim of this study is to observe biofilm disruption due to cavitation generated by a dental ultrasonic scaler (P5XS, Acteon) using a high speed camera and determine how this is achieved. Streptococcus sanguinis biofilm was grown on Thermanox™ coverslips (Nunc, USA) for 4 days. After fixing and staining with crystal violet, biofilm removal was imaged using a high speed camera (AX200, Photron). An ultrasonic scaler tip (tip 10P) was held 2 mm away from the biofilm and operated for 2 s. Bubble oscillations were observed from high speed image sequences and image analysis was used to track bubble motion and calculate changes in bubble radius and velocity on the surface. The results demonstrate that most of the biofilm disruption occurs through cavitation bubbles contacting the surface within 2 s, whether individually or in cavitation clouds. Cleaning occurs through shape oscillating microbubbles on the surface as well as through fluid flow.},

It is found that the oscillating bubble takes a non-spherical shape soon after occurring the Rayleigh collapse following the sound pressure distribution around the bubble. Then, the amplitude of non-spherical deformation is enhanced during small high-frequent oscillations after the Rayleigh collapse due to the ﬂuid inertial eﬀect. Finally, the oscillating bubble is fragmented into two smaller ones with the Laplace pressure gradient becoming the ﬁnal trigger of bubble fragmentation. Besides, the results reveal that the temperature of bubble surface is varied when the non-spherical bubble deformation is large, while during spherical bubble oscillations the surface temperature remains almost unchanged.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to apply high-speed photography and schlieren method to investigate the bubble dynamics between the free surface and a rigid wall. The temporal evolution of the bubble shape and the free surface motion are recorded by two synchronous high-speed cameras. Experiments are carried out for a single bubble generated at various normalized stand-off distances from bubble center to the free surface and to the rigid wall. The results show that (1) three distinctive patterns are identified with the morphology of the bubble and free surface, namely single toroidal bubble without spike (STB), single toroidal bubble with a spike (STBS) and double toroidal bubbles with a spike (DTBS). (2) The dynamic characteristics of the bubble at collapse and rebound stage vary evidently at different patterns, including the bubble shape variations and free surface motion. In detail, the schlieren images show the formation and propagation of shock waves, which explains the radiative process of bubble collapse energy. (3) Qualitative comparisons are carried out for the bubble and free surface at the same pattern. And quantitative analyses are conducted for the jet velocity, bubble collapse position, bubble collapse time and spike height, etc. for different values of bubble-rigid wall distance.},

Then, the postulated model is presented from the viewpoint of a driving force. The potential of this model in furthering our understanding is also demonstrated by re-visiting Sato’s experimental study on synergetic erosion. Further development of this model through experimental and numerical simulations is thus recommended.},

It is intended as a combination of a reference book for those scientists and engineers who work with cavitation or bubble dynamics and as a monograph for advanced students interested in some of the basic problems associated with this category of multiphase flows. A basic knowledge of fluid flow and heat transfer is assumed but otherwise the analytical methods presented are developed from basic principles. The book begins with a chapter on nucleation and describes both the theory and observations of nucleation in flowing and non-flowing systems. The following three chapters provide a systematic treatment of the dynamics of the growth, collapse or oscillation of individual bubbles in otherwise quiescent liquids. Chapter 4 summarizes the state of knowledge of the motion of bubbles in liquids. Chapter 5 describes some of the phenomena which occur in homogeneous bubbly flows with particular emphasis on cloud cavitation and this is followed by a chapter summarizing some of the experiemntal observations of cavitating flows. The last chapter provides a review of the free streamline methods used to treat separated cavity flows with large attached cavities.},

It consists of a biological probability model for cell viability and a bubble dynamic model for its collapsing motion due to the shock pressures. The biological probability model is built by defining a sterilized space of the OH radicals. To determine the radius of the sterilized space, the Herring equation is solved in the bubble dynamic model in consideration of the effect of the heat conductivity and mass transportation. Furthermore, the pressure waveform of incident shock wave used in the model is obtained with the pressure measurement. On the other hand, a bioexperiment of marine Vibrio sp. is carried out using a high-voltage power supply in a cylindrical water chamber. Finally, the viability ratio of marine bacteria estimated by the theoretical model is examined under the experimental conditions of this study. In addition, we also discuss the influence of bubble initial size for predicting the inactivation effects.},

The interaction of a shock wave with a cylinder or a sphere (both referred to as a bubble in this review) is the simplest conﬁguration in which all these processes take place and can be studied in detail. Shock acceleration leads to an initial compression and distortion of the bubble, followed by the formation of a vortex pair in the two-dimensional (2D) case and a vortex ring in the 3D case. At later times, for appropriate combinations of the incident shock strength and density contrast between the bubble and ambient materials, secondary vortices are formed, mass is stripped away from the original bubble, and mixing of the bubble and ambient ﬂuids occurs.},

In particular, the thermal exchange between the gas bubbles and the liquid is described accurately. This aspect of the theory emerges as its most significant component, relegating effects such as the relative motion between the phases to roles of minor importance. Comparison with experimental results substantiates the accuracy of the model for shock waves that have had time to broaden from an initial sharp front to a more diffuse profile. For shock waves closer to inception, marked differences are found between theory and experiment. The same problem affects all other published theoretical treatments. It is concluded that some as yet poorly understood mechanism governs the early-time behaviour of shock waves in bubbly liquids.},

In this paper, a mathematical framework combining the Gilmore model and the method of characteristics is presented to model the shock wave emitted at the end of the bubble collapse. It allows to describe the liquid velocity at the shock front as a function of the radial distance to the bubble center in the case of spherical bubble collapse. Numerical calculations of the liquid velocity at the shock front have shown that this velocity increases with the acoustic amplitude and goes through a maximum as a function of the initial bubble radius. Calculations for diﬀerent gas state equations inside the bubble show that the Van der Waals law predicts a slightly higher liquid velocity at the shock front than when considering a perfect gas law. Finally, decreasing the value of the surface tension at the bubble/liquid interface results in an increase of the liquid velocity at the shock front. Our calculations indicate that the strength of the shock waves emitted upon spherical bubble collapse can cause delamination of typical device structures used in microelectronics.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of ultrasound therapies such as shock wave lithotripsy and histotripsy can be compromised by residual cavitation bubble nuclei that persist following the collapse of primary cavitation. In our previous work, we have developed a unique strategy for mitigating the effects of these residual bubbles using low amplitude ultrasound pulses to stimulate their aggregation and subsequent coalescence—effectively removing them from the field. Here, we further develop this bubble removal strategy through an investigation of the effect of frequency on the consolidation process. Bubble removal pulses ranging from 0.5 – 2 MHz were used to sonicate the population of residual nuclei produced upon collapse of a histotripsy bubble cloud. For each frequency, mechanical index (MI) values ranging from 0 to approximately 1.5 were tested. Results indicated that, when evaluated as a function of bubble removal pulse MI, the efficacy of bubble removal shows markedly similar trends for all frequencies tested. This behavior divides into three distinct regimes (with provided cutoffs being approximate): (1) MI {\textless} 0.2: Minimal effect on the population of remnant cavitation nuclei; (2) 0.2 {\textless} MI {\textless} 1: Aggregation and subsequent coalescence of residual bubbles, the extent of which trends toward a maximum; (3) MI {\textgreater} 1: Bubble coalescence is compromised as bubble removal pulses induce high magnitude inertial cavitation of residual bubbles. The major distinction in these trends came for bubble removal pulses applied at 2 MHz, which were observed to generate the most effective bubble coalescence of all frequencies tested. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of the secondary Bjerknes force being the major facilitator of the consolidation process, the magnitude of which increases when the bubble size distribution is far from resonance such that the phase difference of oscillation of individual bubbles is minimal.},

These bubbles can limit the efficacy of ultrasound therapies such as shock wave lithotripsy and histotripsy, as they attenuate pulses that arrive subsequent to their formation and seed repetitive cavitation activity at a discrete set of sites (cavitation memory). Here, we explore a strategy for the removal of these residual bubbles following a cavitation event, using low amplitude ultrasound pulses to stimulate bubble coalescence. All experiments were conducted in degassed water and monitored using high speed photography. In each case, a 2 MHz histotripsy transducer was used to initiate cavitation activity (a cavitational bubble cloud), the collapse of which generated a population of residual bubble nuclei. This residual nuclei population was then sonicated using a 1 ms pulse from a separate 500 kHz transducer, which we term the ‘bubble removal pulse.’ Bubble removal pulse amplitudes ranging from 0 to 1.7 MPa were tested, and the backlit area of shadow from bubbles remaining in the field following bubble removal was calculated to quantify efficacy. It was found that an ideal amplitude range exists (roughly 180 –570 kPa) in which bubble removal pulses stimulate the aggregation and subsequent coalescence of residual bubble nuclei, effectively removing them from the field. Further optimization of bubble removal pulse sequences stands to provide an adjunct to cavitation-based ultrasound therapies such as shock wave lithotripsy and histotripsy, mitigating the effects of residual bubble nuclei that currently limit their efficacy.},

This forms the basis for a portable, aerial sonar and communications system for both detecting underwater objects such as vehicles and mines as well as for bidirectional acoustic communication between an in-air platform and a submerged platform operating at speed and depth. Two laser systems are required. The first laser system is a high-energy laser, the opto-acoustic transmitter, whose optical energy is converted to acoustic energy at the water surface. The second laser system is a laser interferometer, the acousto-optic sensor that detects underwater sound by measuring the vibrations of the water surface caused by the incident underwater sound field. Historically, acoustic transmitters and detectors need to be submerged to interact with the underwater environment. This remote, aerial, laser-based sonar and communication system presents a revolutionary change in the way sonar and communications can be realized, by remotely activating and detecting underwater acoustics from the air.},

	abstract = {Remnant bubble nuclei generated by primary cavitation collapse can limit the efficiency of histotripsy soft tissue fractionation. When these residual bubbles persist from one histotripsy pulse to the next, they can seed the repetitive nucleation of cavitation bubbles at a discrete set of sites within the focal volume. This effect—referred to as cavitation memory—manifests in inefficient lesion formation, as certain sites within the focal volume are overtreated while others remain undertreated. While the cavitation memory effect can be passively mitigated by using a low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) that affords remnant nuclei sufficient time for dissolution between successive pulses, this low PRF also results in slow lesion production. As such, it would be highly desirable to maintain the high per-pulse efficiency associated with low pulse rates when much higher PRFs are utilized. In this vein we have developed a strategy for the active removal of the remnant bubble nuclei following primary cavitation collapse, using low amplitude ultrasound sequences (termed bubble removal sequences) to stimulate the aggregation and subsequent coalescence of these bubbles. In this study, bubble removal sequences were incorporated in highPRF histotripsy treatment (100 Hz) of a red blood cell tissue-mimicking phantom that allows for the visualization of lesion development in real-time. A series of reference treatments were also conducted at the low PRF of 1 Hz in order to provide a point of comparison when cavitation memory effects are minimal. It was found that bubble removal sequences as short as 1 ms are capable of maintaining the efficacious lesion development characteristics associated with the low PRF of 1 Hz when the much higher pulse rate of 100 Hz is used. These results were then extended to the treatment of a large volume within the tissue phantom, and optimal bubble removal sequences identified for the single-focal-spot case were utilized to homogenize a 10 × 10 mm region at high rate.},

Lysis was accomplished through the delivery of 6 ns, l ¼ 532 nm laser pulses via a 40 3 , 0.8 NA objective to a location 10 mm above conﬂuent monolayers of PtK2 cells. The process dynamics were examined at cell surface densities of 600 and 1000 cells/ mm2 and pulse energies corresponding to 0.7 3 , 1 3 , 2 3 , and 3 3 the threshold for plasma formation. The cell lysis process was imaged at times of 0.5 ns to 50 ms after laser pulse delivery and revealed the processes of plasma formation, pressure wave propagation, and cavitation bubble dynamics. Cavitation bubble expansion was the primary agent of cell lysis with the zone of lysed cells fully established within 600 ns of laser pulse delivery. The spatial extent of cell lysis increased with pulse energy but decreased with cell surface density. Hydrodynamic analysis indicated that cells subject to transient shear stresses in excess of a critical value were lysed while cells exposed to lower shear stresses remained adherent and viable. This critical shear stress is independent of laser pulse energy and varied from ;60–85 kPa for cell monolayers cultured at a density of 600 cells/mm2 to ;180–220 kPa for a surface density of 1000 cells/mm2. The implications for single cell lysis and microsurgery are discussed.},

The calculations rely on a nonlinear model of sound propagation in a cavitating liquid [Louisnard, Ultrason. Sonochem., 19, (2012) 56–65]. Both the vibration amplitude and the liquid level in the vial are parametrically varied. For low liquid levels, a threshold amplitude is required to form a cavitation zone at the bottom of the vial. For increasing vibration amplitudes, the bubble ﬁeld slightly thickens but remains at the vial bottom, and the acoustic ﬁeld saturates, which cannot be captured by linear acoustics. On the other hand, increasing the liquid level may promote the formation of a secondary bubble structure near the glass wall, a few centimeters below the free liquid surface. These predictions suggest that rather complex acoustic ﬁelds and bubble structures can arise even in such small volumes. As the acoustic and bubble ﬁelds govern ice nucleation during the freezing step, the ﬁnal crystal’s size distribution in the frozen product may crucially depend on the liquid level in the vial.},

To gain a better understanding of the physical processes that underlie the bubble motion, numerical simulations are conducted by using a boundary element method with an incompressible formulation. We found a complex jetting behaviour which depends strongly on the relative size of the bubble with respect to the distance between the parallel walls and the initial location of the bubble from the vertical rigid wall. When the bubble is generated far from the vertical rigid wall, a radial jet is formed during bubble collapse leading, in some conditions, to bubble splitting. A bubble generated close to the vertical rigid wall develops a planar jet during its collapse phase, which is directed towards the vertical rigid wall. In the transition region, both a radial and a planar jet are generated. When the bubble diameter at its maximum expansion is much smaller than the distance between the parallel rigid walls, both the penetration of the planar jet on the opposite bubble surface and the formation of the secondary cavitation structure were observed during bubble oscillation. The height of the planar jet increases with increasing the bubble size with respect to the distance between the parallel rigid walls. The jet velocity decreases with increasing the relative bubble size with respect to the distance between the horizontal walls and decreasing the initial location of the bubble from the vertical wall. The complex jetting behaviour is attributed to a diﬀerence between the strength of the pressure gradients acting on the bubble motion during its collapse phase.},

The ﬂuid containers were placed between the explosive charge and steel target to mitigate both the transient and permanent deformation of the target. The effect of ﬂuid container geometry on blast mitigation was evaluated by varying both the height and width of the containers while maintaining a constant volume of ﬂuid, as well as by varying the height and width independently. The best performing container geometry provided a 65\% reduction in the dynamic deformation to a reference steel target, which is more than twice the reduction provided by a steel applique panel of equivalent areal density. The blast mitigation effectiveness of the ﬂuid containers was dependent on their geometry; for the same container volume, variations in container geometry were found to affect the peak dynamic deformation of the steel target by up to 100\%. Numerical simulation of the blast experiments was performed using ANSYS® AUTODYN® and validated through comparison with temporally-resolved deformation signals. The validated numerical model was used to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for blast mitigation. The time-scale of the loading was computed to be too short for container break-up, proving that momentum extraction and water evaporation were not signiﬁcant mitigation mechanisms. Whilst the loading time-scale was also too short for water cavitation to be a major mitigation mechanism, the development and collapse of cavitation bubbles were predicted to affect the loading on the steel targets. The major mitigation mechanisms were analysed to be shadowing of the detonation products and the generation of rarefaction waves, both of which are inﬂuenced by the container geometry. Whilst the ﬂuid itself does not act as an energy absorber, the sound speed of the ﬂuid is important due to the shock-impedance mismatch between the air and the water container and the subsequent pressure wave transmission at sonic speed through the ﬂuid.},

The acoustic emission from a collection of bubbles is measured in a 928 kHz sound ﬁeld. Particle removal tests on a surface, which actually measures the applied physical force by the bubbles on that surface, indicate a very strong dependence on the angle of incidence. In other words, when the traveling wave component is maximized, the average physical force applied by microbubbles reaches a maximum. Almost complete particle removal for 78 nm silica particles was obtained for a traveling wave, while particle removal efﬁciency was reduced to only a few percent when a standing wave was applied. This increase in particle removal for a traveling wave is probably caused by a decrease in bubble trapping at nodes and antinodes in a standing wave ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Two nonlinear models are proposed to investigate the focused acoustic waves that the nonlinear effects will be important inside the liquid around the scatterer. Firstly, the one dimensional solutions for the widely used Westervelt equation with different coordinates are obtained based on the perturbation method with the second order nonlinear terms. Then, by introducing the small parameter (Mach number), a dimensionless formulation and asymptotic perturbation expansion via the compressible potential ﬂow theory is applied. This model permits the decoupling between the velocity potential and enthalpy to second order, with the ﬁrst potential solutions satisfying the linear wave equation (Helmholtz equation), whereas the second order solutions are associated with the linear non-homogeneous equation. Based on the model, the local nonlinear effects of focused acoustic waves on certain volume are studied in which the ﬁndings may have important implications for bubble cavitation/initiation via focused ultrasound called HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound). The calculated results show that for the domain encompassing less than ten times the radius away from the center of the scatterer, the non-linear effect exerts a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the focused high intensity acoustic wave. Moreover, at the comparatively higher frequencies, for the model of spherical wave, a lower Mach number may result in stronger nonlinear effects.},

	abstract = {Single clouds of cavitation bubbles, driven by 254 kHz focused ultrasound at pressure amplitudes in the range of 0.48–1.22 MPa, have been observed via high-speed shadowgraphic imaging at 1 Â 106 frames per second. Clouds underwent repetitive growth, oscillation and collapse (GOC) cycles, with shock-waves emitted periodically at the instant of collapse during each cycle. The frequency of cloud collapse, and coincident shock-emission, was primarily dependent on the intensity of the focused ultrasound driving the activity. The lowest peak-to-peak pressure amplitude of 0.48 MPa generated shock-waves with an average period of 7.9 ± 0.5 ls, corresponding to a frequency of f0/2, half-harmonic to the fundamental driving. Increasing the intensity gave rise to GOC cycles and shock-emission periods of 11.8 ± 0.3, 15.8 ± 0.3, 19.8 ± 0.2 ls, at pressure amplitudes of 0.64, 0.92 and 1.22 MPa, corresponding to the higher-order subharmonics of f0/3, f0/4 and f0/5, respectively. Parallel passive acoustic detection, ﬁltered for the fundamental driving, revealed features that correlated temporally to the shock-emissions observed via high-speed imaging, p(two-tailed) {\textless} 0.01 (r = 0.996, taken over all data). Subtracting the isolated acoustic shock proﬁles from the raw signal collected from the detector, demonstrated the removal of subharmonic spectral peaks, in the frequency domain. The larger cavitation clouds ({\textgreater}200 lm diameter, at maximum inﬂation), that developed under insonations of peak-to-peak pressure amplitudes {\textgreater}1.0 MPa, emitted shock-waves with two or more fronts suggesting non-uniform collapse of the cloud. The observations indicate that periodic shock-emissions from acoustically driven cavitation clouds provide a source for the cavitation subharmonic signal, and that shock structure may be used to study intra-cloud dynamics at sub-microsecond timescales.},

	abstract = {Rigid or deformable bodies moving through continuously stratified layers or across sharp interfaces are involved in a wide variety of geophysical and engineering applications, with both miscible and immiscible fluids. In most cases, the body moves while pulling a column of fluid, in which density and possibly viscosity differ from those of the neighboring fluid. The presence of this column usually increases the fluid resistance to the relative body motion, frequently slowing down its settling or rise in a dramatic manner. This column also exhibits specific dynamics that depend on the nature of the fluids and on the various physical parameters of the system, especially the strength of the density/viscosity stratification and the relative magnitude of inertia and viscous effects. In the miscible case, as stratification increases, the wake becomes dominated by the presence of a downstream jet, which may undergo a specific instability. In immiscible fluids, the viscosity contrast combined with capillary effects may lead to strikingly different evolutions of the column, including pinch-off followed by the formation of a drop that remains attached to the body, or a massive fragmentation phenomenon. This review discusses the flow organization and its consequences on the body motion under a wide range of conditions, as well as potentialities and limitations of available models aimed at predicting the body and column dynamics.},

Mag. 16 (1933) 235], i.e., size of oscillating bubble is inversely related to the frequency of its volume oscillations. Decomposition of the pressure signal measured by the hydrophone in frequency domain of FFT spectrum and then inverse FFT reconstruction of the signal at each frequency level has been carried out to get the information about each of the bubble/cavity oscillation event. The number mean radius of the bubble size is calculated to be in the range of 50–80 lm and it was not found to vary much with the spatial distribution of acoustic ﬁeld strength of the ultrasound processor used in the work. However, the number density of the oscillating bubbles and the nature of the distribution were found to vary in different horizontal planes away from the driving transducer surface in the ultrasonic bath. A separate set of experiments on erosion assessment studies were carried out using a thin aluminium foil, revealing a phenomena of active region of oscillating bubbles at antinodal points of the stationary waves, identical to the information provided by the acoustic emission spectra at the same location in the ultrasonic bath.},

	abstract = {Extreme cavitation scenarios, such as water column separations in hydraulic systems during transient processes caused by large cavitation bubbles, can lead to catastrophic destruction. In the present paper, we study the onset criteria and dynamics of large cavitation bubbles in a tube. A new cavitation number Ca2 = l∗−1Ca0 is proposed to describe the maximum length Lmax of the cavitation bubble, where l∗ is a non-dimensional length of the water column indicating its slenderness, and Ca0 is the classic cavitation number. Combined with the onset criteria for acceleration-induced cavitation (Ca1 {\textless} 1, Pan et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 114, 2017, pp. 8470–8474), we show that the occurrence of large cylindrical cavitation bubbles requires both Ca2 {\textless} 1 and Ca1 {\textless} 1 simultaneously. We also establish a Rayleigh-type model for the dynamics of large cavitation bubbles in a tube. The bubbles colla√pse√at a ﬁn√ite end speed, and the time from the maximum bubble size to collapse is Tc = 2 lLmax ρ/p∞, where l is the length of the water column, Lmax is the maximum bubble length, ρ is the liquid density and p∞ is the reference pressure in the far ﬁeld. The analytical results are validated against systematic experiments using a modiﬁed ‘tube-arrest’ apparatus, which can decouple acceleration and velocity. The results in the current work can guide design and operation of hydraulic systems encountering transient processes.},

A sound wave is used to explode an electron bubble for a fraction of a microsecond. While the bubble is expanded, it is illuminated by light from a ﬂash lamp. We describe the details of the experiment and show results obtained. In some cases, an electron is seen to follow a snakelike path. Our tentative explanation is that the electron is sliding along a quantized vortex line. If this interpretation is correct, the recorded track of the electron provides an image of the path of the vortex.},

	abstract = {The details of nonlinear axisymmetric oscillations and collapse of bubbles subject to large internal or external pressure disturbances, are studied via a boundary integral method. Weak viscous eﬀects on the liquid side are accounted for by integrating the equations of motion across the boundary layer that is formed adjacent to the interface. Simulations of single-cavitation bubble luminescence (SCBL) and single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) are performed under conditions similar to reported experimental observations, aiming at capturing the details of bubble collapse. It is shown that any small initial deviation from sphericity, modeled through a small initial elongation along the axis of symmetry, may result in the formation and impact of two counter-propagating jets during collapse of the bubble, provided the amplitude of the initial disturbance is large enough and the viscosity of the surrounding ﬂuid is small enough. Comparison between simulations and experimental observations show that this is the case for bubbles induced via a nano-second laser pulse (SCBL) during a luminescence event. In a similar fashion, simulations show that loss of sphericity accompanied with jet formation and impact during collapse is also possible with acoustically trapped bubbles in a standing pressure wave (SBSL), due to the many afterbounces of the bubble during its collapse phase. In both cases jet impact occurs as a result of P2 growth in the form of an afterbounce instability. When the sound amplitude is decreased or liquid viscosity is increased the intensity of the afterbounce is decreased and jet impact is suppressed. When the sound amplitude is increased jet formation is superceded by Rayleigh–Taylor instability. In the same context stable luminescence is quenched in experimental observations. In both SCBL and SBSL simulations the severity of jet impact during collapse is quite large, and its local nature quite distinct. This attests to the fact that it is an energy focusing mechanism whose importance in generating the conditions under which a luminescence event is observed should be further investigated.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of cavitation noise have been performed under the experimental conditions reported by Ashokkumar et al. (2007) [26]. The results of numerical simulations have indicated that the temporal ﬂuctuation in the number of bubbles results in the broad-band noise. ‘‘Transient” cavitation bubbles, which disintegrate into daughter bubbles mostly in a few acoustic cycles, generate the broadband noise as their short lifetimes cause the temporal ﬂuctuation in the number of bubbles. Not only active bubbles in light emission (sonoluminescence) and chemical reactions but also inactive bubbles generate the broad-band noise. On the other hand, ‘‘stable” cavitation bubbles do not generate the broad-band noise. The weaker broad-band noise from a low-concentration surfactant solution compared to that from pure water observed experimentally by Ashokkumar et al. is caused by the fact that most bubbles are shape stable in a low-concentration surfactant solution due to the smaller ambient radii than those in pure water. For a relatively high number density of bubbles, the bubble–bubble interaction intensiﬁes the broad-band noise. Harmonics in cavitation noise are generated by both ‘‘stable” and ‘‘transient” cavitation bubbles which pulsate nonlinearly with the period of ultrasound.},

In this paper, an isolated bubble trajectory in a single‐phase swirling flow field of the separator is investigated theoretically. The mathematical modeling of the forces acting on the bubble is established, and the motion equations of bubble are solved numerically. The axial and circumferential velocities of the swirling flow are approximated by the combination of 2 co‐flow Batchelor vortices. Notably, it is a promising way to obtain the analytical expression of velocity field in this gas‐liquid separator. The results indicate that the separation length will increase as decreasing diameter of bubble and swirl number. Hence, the numerical simulation provides an effective tool to predict bubble trajectory and optimize the design of the gas‐liquid separator.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to apply CLSVOF method to investigate the single bubble dynamics in acoustic travelling waves. The Naiver-Stokes equation considering the acoustic radiation force is proposed and validated to capture the bubble behaviors. And the CLSVOF method, which can capture the continuous geometric properties and satisﬁes mass conservation, is applied in present work. Firstly, the regime map, depending on the dimensionless acoustic pressure amplitude and acoustic wave number, is constructed to present diﬀerent bubble behaviors. Then, the time evolution of the bubble oscillation is investigated and analyzed. Finally, the eﬀect of the direction and the damping coeﬃcient of acoustic wave propagation on the bubble behavior are also considered. The numerical results show that the bubble presents distinct oscillation types in acoustic travelling waves, namely, volume oscillation, shape oscillation, and splitting oscillation. For the splitting oscillation, the formation of jet, splitting of bubble, and the rebound of sub-bubbles may lead to substantial increase in pressure ﬂuctuations on the boundary. For the shape oscillation, the nodes and antinodes of the acoustic pressure wave contribute to the formation of the “cross shape” of the bubble. It should be noted that the direction of the bubble translation and bubble jet are always towards the direction of wave propagation. In addition, the damping coeﬃcient causes bubble in shape oscillation to be of asymmetry in shape and inequality in size, and delays the splitting process.},

This paper is intended to study the complex interaction among three in-line arranged in-phase bubbles. This work illustrates the interactions of three bubbles oscillation and the shockwave motion after the recombination of the plasma nanosecond laser excited. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) model is used to numerically analyze the behaviour of same equilibrium size, same distance and in-phase multiple-bubbles, which enables tracking of the gas-liquid interface and the field. The numerical results indicate that, in the expanding stage, due to the pressure gradient, bubbles at both ends move towards the centre, while the bubble surfaces facing to other bubbles get flattening. The central bubble has longer oscillation period than the side bubbles. In the shrinking stage, the side bubbles get deformation faster, and then collapse with a jet or get adhere to the central bubble. The initial high-pressure bubble radiates a shockwave at the beginning of the expansion. The shock wave propagates outwards from the point source in a circular pattern, resulting in interference in the overlap of the two shock waves. A curved pressure wave, which is parallel to the in-line array, is produced by the interference of multiple shock waves. The pressure wave decays to an acoustic wave after a certain distance according to its initial intensity. In particular, a significant variable γ=D/(R+R) deserves studying in this progress.},

Numerical modelling is undertaken to determine the spatio-temporal evolution of cavitation bubbles. The calculus of the emergence of cavitation bubbles due to the acoustic driving (by taking into account interactions between the sound ﬁeld and bubbles’ distribution) gives a cartography of bubbles’ emergence within the reactor. Computation of their motion induced by the pressure gradients occurring in the reactor show that they migrate to the pressure nodes.

	abstract = {The present work deals with the numerical investigation of a collapsing bubble in a liquid–gas ﬂuid, which is modeled as a single compressible medium. The medium is characterized by the stiffened gas law using different material parameters for the two phases. For the discretization of the stiffened gas model, the approach of Saurel and Abgrall is employed where the ﬂow equations, here the Euler equations, for the conserved quantities are approximated by a ﬁnite volume scheme, and an upwind discretization is used for the non-conservative transport equations of the pressure law coefﬁcients. The original ﬁrst-order discretization is extended to higher order applying second-order ENO reconstruction to the primitive variables. The derivation of the non-conservative upwind discretization for the phase indicator, here the gas fraction, is presented for arbitrary unstructured grids. The efﬁciency of the numerical scheme is signiﬁcantly improved by employing local grid adaptation. For this purpose, multiscale-based grid adaptation is used in combination with a multilevel time stepping strategy to avoid small time steps for coarse cells. The resulting numerical scheme is then applied to the numerical investigation of the 2-D axisymmetric collapse of a gas bubble in a free ﬂow ﬁeld and near to a rigid wall. The numerical investigation predicts physical features such as bubble collapse, bubble splitting and the formation of a liquid jet that can be observed in experiments with laser-induced cavitation bubbles. Opposite to the experiments, the computations reveal insight to the state inside the bubble clearly indicating that these features are caused by the acceleration of the gas due to shock wave focusing and reﬂection as well as wave interaction processes. While incompressible models have been used to provide useful predictions on the change of the bubble shape of a collapsing bubble near a solid boundary, we wish to study the effects of shock wave emissions into the ambient liquid on the bubble collapse, a phenomenon that may not be captured using an incompressible ﬂuid model.

To validate the present model, the results are compared with the experiment recorded by a high-speed camera and the data in a published literature. Favorable agreements of bubble shape history are observed. Then, the inﬂuence of the size ratiol(deﬁned as l ¼ Rm,1/Rm,2, Rm,1 r Rm,2; Rm is the maximum radius attained in a free ﬁeld) on bubble behaviors is investigated numerically.

Using a high-speed camera, three regimes (no cavitation, cavitation, and pseudo-cavitation) are identified within a broad range of nanoparticles concentration and size. The underlying correlation among cavitation, nanoparticles and temperature is revealed by the direct observation of spatiotemporal evolution of temperature using a thermal cameral. These findings indicate that nanoparticles not only act as preexisted nuclei to promote nucleation for cavitation, but also likely affect temperature to change the nucleation rate as well. Moreover, by exploiting a compound hexane/water interface, a novel core-shell cavitation is demonstrated. This approach might be utilized to attain and control cavitations by choosing nanoparticles and designing interfaces while operating at a lower laser intensity, for versatile technological applications in material science and medical surgery.},

Nine distributions were employed, and their parameters were estimated using the method of moments. The Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) metric was used to quantitatively compare the fit of each candidate distribution to the experimental envelope distribution. The study indicates that the generalized gamma distribution best models the statistics of the envelope data of the three media encountered: LN parenchyma, fat and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Furthermore, the envelope statistics of the LN parenchyma satisfy the pre-Rayleigh condition. In terms of high fitting accuracy and computationally efficient parameter estimation, the gamma distribution is the best choice to model the envelope statistics of LN parenchyma, while, the Weibull distribution is the best choice to model the envelope statistics of fat and PBS. These results will contribute to the development of more-accurate and automatic 3D segmentation of LNs for ultrasonic detection of clinically significant LN metastases.},

	abstract = {Differences in the amount of water−mist separation and the intensity of luminol chemiluminescence for pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) ultrasound at 135 kHz have been investigated. The amount of mist generated is estimated using the cooling rate of a copper plate sprayed with the mist. For pulsed operation with an appropriate duty cycle, the cooling rate and the cooling rate per input power to the transducer are higher by 4 and 12 times compared to CW operation, respectively. This is due to the amplitude of the pulsed ultrasound being higher than that for CW ultrasound. Relatively low power pulsed operation can successfully produce both a higher sonochemiluminescence (SCL) intensity and cooling rate than those for CW ultrasound. The sonochemical reaction for pulsed ultrasound occurs at the same input power threshold as that for mist separation, whereas for CW ultrasound, the former threshold is lower than the latter. A higher number of large bubbles is produced with CW ultrasound than that with pulsed ultrasound. To achieve a sound pressure amplitude sufficient for mist separation near the surface of a liquid, it is necessary to expel these bubbles by changing the sound field from resonant standing waves to progressive waves that give rise to capillary waves on the liquid surface.},

The numerical methods are implemented in a ﬂexible, modular framework that is amenable to future development. The methods we employ are validated via comparisons to experimental results for shock–bubble, shock–droplet, and shock–watercylinder interaction problems and veriﬁed to be free of spurious oscillations for material-interface advection and gas–liquid Riemann problems. For smooth solutions, such as the advection of an isentropic vortex, the methods are veriﬁed to be high-order accurate.

Particle removal efﬁciency (PRE) increases with KCl concentration and transducer power density and much lower power densities may be used at higher KCl concentration for a comparable level of cleaning. Enhanced cleaning in KCl solutions has been explained as due to two types of electro-acoustic potentials, namely, ionic vibration potential (IVP) and colloidal vibration potential (CVP) that arise when the sound wave propagates through the electrolyte solution. Theoretical computations have shown that the removal forces due to CVP are much larger in magnitude than those due to IVP and are comparable to van der Waals adhesion forces.},

For diagnostic applications, their sound scattering properties yield improved imaging, when the microbubbles are used as contrast agents. The harmonics and subharmonics responses from the bubbles assist in distinguishing the acoustic scattering of blood from that of the surrounding tissue. The therapeutic use of microbubbles has recently been the subject of much interest. In a HIFU treatment, the heat generated by the bubble motion contributes an enhanced localized heating eﬀect from the ultrasound. In the lithotripsy of renal calculi, the acoustic cloud cavitation contributes to the comminution of the renal stones. In all these applications, it is essential to understand the microbubbles and bubble cloud dynamics. The bubble motion and bubble cloud behavior are strongly inﬂuenced by the internal phenomena of the bubbles, such as thermal diﬀusion, mist formation, mass diﬀusion and heat and mass transfer through the bubble wall. In our research, bubble and bubble cloud dynamics in the medical ultrasound ﬁeld have been examined.

	abstract = {NdYAG laser photodisruption with nanosecond (ns)pulses is an established method for intraocular surgery. In order to assess whether an increased precision can be achieved by the use of picosecond (ps) pulses, the plasma size, the shock wave characteristics, and the cavitation bubble expansion after optical breakdown with ps- and ns-laser pulses were investigated by time-resolved photography and acoustic measurements. NdYAG laser pulses with a duration of 30 ps and 6 ns, respectively, were focused into a water-filled glass cuvette. Frequency doubled light from the same laser pulses was optically delayed between 2 ns and 136ns and used as illuminationlight source for photography. Since the individual events were well reproducible, the shock wave and bubble wall position could be determined as a function of time. From the slope of these r(t) curves, the shock wave and bubble wall velocities were determined, and the shock wave pressure was calculated from the shock velocity. The plasma size at various laser pulse energies was measured from photographs of the plasma radiation. The breakdown thresholds at 30 ps and 6 ns pulse duration were found to be 15 p J and 200 pJ, respectively. At threshold, ps-plasmas are shorter than ns-plasmas, but at the same pulse energy they are always -2.5 times longer. The initial shock pressures were 17 kbar after ps-pulses with an energy of 50 pJ, and 21 kbar after 1 m J ns-pulses. The pressure amplitude decayed much faster after the ps-pulses. The maximum expansion velocity of the cavitation bubble was 350 m/s after a 50 pJ ps-pulse,but 1,600 m/s after a 1m J ns-pulse.The side effects of intraocular microsurgery associated with shock wave emission and cavitation bubble expansion can be considerably reduced by the use of ps-pulses, and new applications of photodisruption may become possible. o 1994 WiIey-{\textasciitilde}issI, nc.},

Maximizing the transfer eﬃciency of the acoustic energy between electromechanical transducers and water at cavitation is crucial when designing industrial ultrasonic reactors with large active volumes. This can be achieved by matching the acoustic impedances of transducers to water at cavitation using appropriately designed ultrasonic horns. In the present work, a set of criteria characterizing the matching capabilities of ultrasonic horns is developed. It is shown that none of the commonly used tapered-shape horns can achieve the necessary conditions. An analytical method for designing ﬁve-element acoustic horns with the desirable matching properties is introduced, and ﬁve novel types of such horns, most suitable for practical applications, are proposed. An evaluation of the horns’ performance is presented in a set of experiments, demonstrating the validity of the developed theoretical methodology. Power transfer eﬃciency increase by almost an order of magnitude is shown to be possible with the presented horn designs, as compared to those traditionally utilized.},

	abstract = {We investigated the mechanisms of material ejection in Q-switched Er:YAG laser tissue ablation (70-ns pulse duration) where moderate and large radiant exposures are associated with large volumetric energy densities in the target material. For water, an initial phase of non-equilibrium surface vaporization is followed by an explosive vaporization of the superﬁcial liquid volume from a supercritical state. The ablation of deeper layers with lower peak temperatures proceeds as phase explosion. For mechanically strong tissues, non-equilibrium surface vaporization is followed by a vapour explosion coupled with thermal dissociation of the biomolecules into volatile products. In deeper layers, ablation proceeds as conﬁned boiling with mechanical tearing of the tissue matrix by the vapour pressure. The recoil stress induced at a radiant exposure of 5.4 J/cm2 is in the order of 500–900 MPa. For water and soft tissues such as liver, the recoil causes a powerful secondary material expulsion. For stronger tissues such as skin, no secondary expulsion was observed even though the recoil stress largely exceeds the static tensile strength of the tissue. Recoil-induced material expulsion results in an increase of both ablation efﬁciency and mechanical side effects of ablation. Theoretical modelling of the succession of phase transitions in nanosecondlaser tissue ablation and of recoil-induced material expulsion remain a major challenge for future work.},

	abstract = {Water clouds are considered as the common dispersion systems suspending in the air. In general, droplets can be treated as a transparent dielectric for the laser field. However, once the intensity of laser exceeds the breakdown threshold, laserinduced plasma will be generated in the droplet. This plasma is able to significant influence the propagation of laser field. Since the water clouds are constituted by the countless droplets, it is reasonable to study the interaction between intense laser field and a single droplet as the starting point. The laser-induced plasma is usually generated instantaneously in a micro spatial volume. It is difficult to reveal the detail structure of plasma. We will provide a transient coupling model to study the time-evolution of the laser-induced plasma propagating in a single droplet. Using the above model, we will bring insight into the breakdown threshold firstly. On the other hand, there are abundant features in the both plasma and its coupling laser field. The plasma is initially generated at the location where laser field propagates away from the droplet, if the intensity of the laser is not very high. Meanwhile, after the plasma generates, the droplet becomes opaque. Large amount of laser energy then is deposited in the droplet. The saturation of the energy deposit can be revealed in our model. We would expect this transient coupling model is helpful to estimate the propagation length of the intense laser pulse while it is passing through the water cloud.},

          , 
            Transforming a laser beam into a mass flow has been a challenge both scientifically and technologically. We report the discovery of a new optofluidic principle and demonstrate the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window. To generate a flow or stream in the same path as the refracted laser beam in pure water from an arbitrary spot on the window, we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous solution of Au nanoparticles. A flow will emerge from the focused laser spot on the window after the laser is turned on for a few to tens of minutes; the flow remains after the colloidal solution is completely replaced by pure water. Microscopically, this transformation is made possible by an underlying plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated cavity, which is self-fabricated on the glass by nanoparticle-assisted laser etching and exhibits size and shape uniquely tailored to the incident beam profile. Hydrophone signals indicate that the flow is driven via acoustic streaming by a long-lasting ultrasound wave that is resonantly generated by the laser and the cavity through the photoacoustic effect. The principle of this light-driven flow via ultrasound, that is, photoacoustic streaming by coupling photoacoustics to acoustic streaming, is general and can be applied to any liquid, opening up new research and applications in optofluidics as well as traditional photoacoustics and acoustic streaming.},

	abstract = {Cavitation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in ocean engineering. In order to ﬁgure out the relationship between cavitation cloud and cavitation erosion, high-speed visualization and erosion test of cavitation jet were simultaneously performed. The temporal and spatial distributions of cavitation cloud was analyzed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the morphology of eroded specimen was analyzed from both macroscopic and microcosmic perspectives. The results show that POD modes of side view images are able to estimate the maximum radial distribution of cavitation pits, while the energy fraction of the ﬁrst POD mode can serve as an indicator of specimen mass loss. The intensity of cavitation erosion is decided by both the bubble concentration and collapse intensity at specimen surface. At a medium standoff distance, where collapse intensity and bubble concentration are well compromised, maximum cavitation erosion is achieved. The aggravation of cavitation erosion is the combined consequences of the growth of single cavitation pits and the connection of adjacent pits. These results suggest that the collapse of cavitation bubbles is a necessary, but not sufﬁcient, condition for severe cavitation erosion. The ﬁndings are expected to improve the physical understanding of the relationship between cavitation phenomenon and cavitation damage.},

The cavitation noises emitted in different sonication conditions were recorded to study the dynamical behavior of the bubbles. The frequency spectra of the noises suggest that the dispersing state of the bubbles severely inﬂuence the oscillations of bubbles, and that the nonlinear feature of the dynamics of cavitation bubbles, imposed by the mutual bubble-bubble interaction, gradually develops with the decrease of the dispersing height. Theoretical analysis shows that the size difference between the interacting bubbles should be responsible for the increase of nonlinearity of the oscillation, and that the decrease of the distance between them could effectively enhance the nonlinear feature of the oscillation of the bubble, both of which agree well with the experimental observation.},

The expansion of the bubble on the three kinds of surfaces was simulated numerically. The pressure ﬁelds on the inner side of the surfaces and the energy that the propelled surfaces received from the expanding bubble were investigated numerically. For the three kinds of surfaces, the collapse times of the nonspherical bubbles were all less than the Rayleigh collapse time of the spherical bubble. The bubble on a narrow-shaped surface grew faster in a certain direction, which indicates that the propelling force was concentrated spatially and temporally. However, the most narrow-shaped surface did not get the most propelling energy. The repetition rate and spatial array density of the laser pulse cannot be too high, because of the scattering effect of the bubble. As a result of the laser plasma shielding and bubble scattering, high pulse energy does not necessarily result in a high propelling force. The narrow-shaped surfaces experienced higher shock damage, and emitted stronger noise.},

This study employs a high-resolution front-tracking framework to numerically investigate this phenomenon. The modelling paradigm is validated extensively and then used to explore the parametric space of interest. We provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the collapse process, which we categorize into three phases, based on the principal feature dominating each phase. This results in the characterization of numerous previously unidentiﬁed features important in the evolution of the process and in the emergence of peak temperatures and pressures. For example, we discover that the peak pressure does not occur as a result of the impact of the main transverse jet (also called the re-entrant jet) but later in the collapse. We perform fully three-dimensional simulations, showing that threedimensional instabilities are limited to the small-scale details of collapse, and continue by comparing collapse of cylindrical and spherical bubbles. We detail a parametric investigation varying the shock strength from 100 MPa to 100 GPa. A counter-intuitive discovery is that the maximum gas density decreases with increasing shock strength.},

	abstract = {The LASIK procedure is a well established laser based treatment in ophthalmology. Nowadays it includes a cutting of the corneal tissue bases on ultra short pulses which are focused below the tissue surface to create an optical breakdown and hence a dissection of the tissue. The energy of the laser pulse is absorbed by non-linear processes that result in an expansion of a cavitation bubble and rupturing of the tissue. Due to a reduction of the duration of treatment the current development of ultra short laser systems points to higher repetition rates. This in turn results in a probable interaction between different cavitation bubbles of adjacent optical breakdowns. While the interaction of one single laser pulse with biological tissue is analyzed reasonably well experimentally and theoretically, the interaction of several spatial and temporal following pulses is scarcely determined yet. We present a high-speed photography analysis of cavitation bubble interaction for two spatial separated laser-induced optical breakdowns varying the laser pulse energy as well as the spatial distance. Depending on a change of these parameters different kinds of interactions such as a flattening and deformation of bubble shape, asymmetric water streams and jet formation were observed. The results of this research can be used to comprehend and optimize the cutting effect of ultra short pulse laser systems with high repetition rates ({\textgreater} 1 MHz).},

The previous separation technique, however, is applicable to particles with diameters similar to a wavelength of the irradiated ultrasound or with smaller diameters than that. Hence, particles which are larger than mm-order in diameter are difﬁcult to be manipulated with MHz-band ultrasound. In the present study, to clarify an unknown ﬂocculation mechanism of the particles in an ultrapure water under kHz-band ultrasound irradiation, we quantitatively discussed an interaction between the particle motion and the acoustic cavitation bubble motion based on the experimental results. First, we successfully captured the particle motion and acoustic-cavitation-oriented bubble motion simultaneously by using a high-speed video camera. Second, we measured the distribution of the sound pressure in the water phase and discussed the relationship between that of the sound pressure and the motion of the particle and the acoustic cavitation bubble. Finally, we investigated the effects of the gravity force, the acoustic radiation force and the spatial heterogeneity of the pressure acting on the particle. By combining the results, we found out that an acoustic-cavitation-oriented bubble adhered to the particle and the particles moved toward the pressure anti-nodes of the standing wave by the acoustic radiation force acting on the adhering acoustic-cavitation-oriented bubble.},

	abstract = {Plasma and vapor bubble formation and evolution after a nanosecond laser pulse delivered to aluminum targets inside water were studied by fast photography. This technique was also applied to monitor the plasma produced by a second laser pulse and for different interpulse delays. The bubble growth was evident only after 3 μs from the ﬁrst laser pulse and the bubble shape changed during expansion and collapse cycles. The evolution and propagation of the initial shockwave and its reﬂections both from the back sample surface and cell walls were detected by Schlieren photography. The primary plasma develops in two phases: violent particle expulsion and ionization during the ﬁrst μs, followed by slow plasma growth from the ablation crater into the evolving vapor bubble. The shape of the secondary plasma strongly depends on the inner bubble pressure whereas the particle expulsion into the expanded bubble is much less evident. Both the primary and secondary plasma have similar duration of about 30 μs. Detection efﬁciency of the secondary plasma is much reduced by light refraction at the curved bubble–water interface, which behaves as a negative lens; this leads to an apparent reduction of the plasma dimensions. Defocusing power of the bubble lens increases with its expansion due to the lowering of the vapor's refraction index with respect to that of the surrounding liquid (Lazic et al., 2012 [1]). Smell's reﬂections of secondary plasma radiation at the expanded bubble wall redistribute the detected intensity on a wavelength-dependent way and allow gathering of the emission also from the external plasma layer that otherwise, would not enter into the optical system.},

	abstract = {The pulsation of ultrasonic cavitation bubbles at various dissolved-air concentration in a sonochemical reaction ﬁeld of standing-wave type is investigated experimentally by laser-light scattering. When a thin light sheet, ﬁner than half the wavelength of sound, is introduced into the cavitation bubbles at an antinode of sound pressure, the scattered light intensity oscillates. The peak-to-trough light intensity is correlated with the number of bubbles that contribute to the sonochemical reaction. It is shown that as the dissolved air concentration becomes higher, the weighted center of the spatial distribution of the peak-to-trough intensity tends to shift towards the liquid surface. At higher concentration of the dissolved air, a great deal of bubbles with size distribution generated due to coalescence between bubbles disturbs sound propagation to change the sound phase easily. A standing wave to trap tiny oscillating bubbles is established only at the side which is nearer to the liquid surface. Also at higher concentration, liquid ﬂow induced by drag motion of bubbles by the action of radiation force becomes apparent and position-unstable region of bubble is enlarged from the side of sound source towards the liquid surface. Therefore, the position of oscillating bubbles active for sonochemical reaction is limited at the side which is nearer to the liquid surface at higher concentration of the dissolved air.},

	abstract = {In this study, the coalescence time between two contacting sub-resonance size bubbles was measured experimentally under an acoustic pressure ranging from 10 kPa to 120 kPa, driven at a frequency of 22.4 kHz. The coalescence time obtained under sonication was much longer compared to that calculated by the ﬁlm drainage theory for a free bubble surface without surfactants. It was found that under the inﬂuence of an acoustic ﬁeld, the coalescence time could be probabilistic in nature, exhibiting upper and lower limits of coalescence times which are prolonged when both the maximum surface approach velocity and secondary Bjerknes force increases. The size of the two contacting bubbles is also important. For a given acoustic pressure, bubbles having a larger average size and size difference were observed to exhibit longer coalescence times. This could be caused by the phase difference between the volume oscillations of the two bubbles, which in turn affects the minimum ﬁlm thickness reached between the bubbles and the ﬁlm drainage time. These results will have important implications for developing ﬁlm drainage theory to account for the effect of bubble translational and volumetric oscillations, bubble surface ﬂuctuations and microstreaming.},

	abstract = {Sonoluminescence and sonochemistry from a cavitation ﬁeld generated by an electrohydraulic shockwave lithotripter were investigated as functions of spark discharge voltage (13 to 21 kV) and pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) (0.5 to 2.0 Hz). Sonochemical activity, measured with an iodide dosimeter, increased with both voltage and PRF. Sonoluminescence was measured in an acoustically matched light-tight box. The envelope of the light intensity was measured in a temporally gated region extending from the initial arrival of the shock wave (resulting in bubble compression) to the ﬁnal inertial collapse of the bubble cloud, which follows hundreds of ␮s after passage of the shock wave. The initial compression resulted in greater sonoluminescence emissions, suggesting that the initial bubble compression due to the leading positive pressure spike from the lithotripter generated higher temperatures than the inertial collapse of the bubble. These unexpected results are consistent with some recent calculations in which the vapor pressure of the liquid limits compressional heating.

	abstract = {The violent collapse of bubble clusters is thought to damage adjacent material in both engineering and biomedical applications. Yet the complexities of the root mechanisms have restricted theoretical descriptions to significantly simplified configurations. Reduced-physics models based upon either homogenization or arrays of idealized spherical bubbles do reproduce important gross cluster-scale features. However, these models neglect detailed local bubble–bubble interactions, which are expected to mediate damage mechanisms. To describe these bubble-scale interactions, we simulate the expansion and subsequent collapse of a hemispherical cluster of 50 bubbles adjacent to a plane rigid wall, explicitly representing both the asymmetric dynamics of each bubble within the cluster and the compressible-fluid mechanics of bubble–bubble interactions. Results show that the collapse propagates inward, as visualized in experiments, and that geometric focusing generates high impulsive pressures. This gross behaviour is nearly independent of the specific arrangement of bubbles within the cluster and matches predictions from the corresponding particle and homogenized models we consider. The peak pressure in the detailed simulations is associated with the centremost bubble, which causes a corresponding peak pressure on the nearby wall. However, the peak pressures in all cases are a small fraction – over a factor of ten times smaller in many cases – of those predicted in the corresponding reduced models. This is due to the enhanced focusing in the homogeneous model and the spherical constraint on each bubble in the particle models assessed. These would be important factors to consider in any subsequent predictions of wall damage based upon reduced models.},

	abstract = {Laser-induced cavitation bubbles near a curved rigid boundary are observed experimentally using high-speed photography. An image theory is applied to obtain 
information on global bubble motion while a boundary integral method is employed 
to gain a more detailed understanding of the behaviour of a liquid jet that threads 
a collapsing bubble, creating a toroidal bubble. Comparisons between the theory 
and experiment show that when a comparable sized bubble is located near a rigid 
boundary the bubble motion is significantly influenced by the surface curvature of 
the boundary, which is characterized by a parameter ζ, giving convex walls for ζ {\textless} 1, 
concave walls for ζ {\textgreater} 1 and a flat wall when ζ = 1. If a boundary is slightly concave, 
the most pronounced migration occurs at the first bubble collapse. The velocity of 
a liquid jet impacting on the far side of the bubble surface tends to increase with 
decreasing parameter ζ. In the case of a convex boundary, the jet velocity is larger 
than that generated in the flat boundary case. Although the situation considered 
here is restricted to axisymmetric motion without mean flow, this result suggests that 
higher pressures can occur when cavitation bubbles collapse near a non-flat boundary. 
Bubble separation, including the pinch-off phenomenon, is observed in the final stage 
of the collapse of a bubble, with the oblate shape at its maximum volume attached to 
the surface of a convex boundary, followed by bubble splitting which is responsible 
for further bubble proliferation.},

Under a pulsed laser excitation, any point on the plate can generate a directional long-lasting ultrasound wave which drives the fluid via acoustic streaming. Manipulating and programming laser beams can easily create a single pump, a moving pump, and multiple pumps. The underlying pumping mechanism of photoacoustic streaming is verified by high-speed imaging of the fluid motion after a single laser pulse. As many light-absorbing materials have been identified for efficient photoacoustic generation, photoacoustic micropumps can have diversity in their implementation. These laser-driven fabrication-free micropumps open up a generation of pumping technology and opportunities for easy integration and versatile microfluidic applications.},

	abstract = {The thermal decomposition of 9,10 diphenylanthracene peroxide (DPAO2) generates DPA and a mix of triplet and singlet molecular oxygen. For DPAO2 the efﬁciency to produce singlet molecular oxygen is 0.35. On the other hand, it has shown that many thermal reactions can be carried out through the interaction of molecules with ultrasound. Ultrasound irradiation can create hydrodynamic stress (sonomechanical process), inertial cavitation (pyrolitic process) and long range effects mediated by radicals or ROS. Sonochemical reactions can be originated by pyrolytic like process, shock mechanical waves, thermal reactions and radical and ROS mediated reactions. Sonolysis of pure water can yield hydrogen or hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide (ROS). When DPAO2 in 1,4 dioxane solution is treated with 20 or 24 kHz and different power intensity the production of molecular singlet oxygen is observed. Speciﬁc scavengers like tetracyclone (TC) are used to demonstrate it. The efﬁciency now is 0.85 showing that the sonochemical process is much more efﬁcient that the thermal one. Another endoperoxide, artemisinin was also studied. Unlike the concept of photosensitizer of photodynamic therapy, in spite of large amount of reported results in literature, the term sonosensitizer and the sonosensitization process are not well deﬁned. We deﬁne sonosensitized reaction as one in which a chemical species decompose as consequence of cavitation phenomena producing ROS or other radicals and some other target species does undergo a chemical reaction. The concept could be reach rapidly other peroxides which are now under experimental studies. For artemisinin, an important antimalarian and anticancer drug, was established that ultrasound irradiation increases the effectiveness of the treatment but without any explanation. We show that artemisinin is an endoperoxide and behaves as a sonosensitizer in the sense of our deﬁnition.},

	abstract = {A free-Lagrange numerical method is implemented to simulate the axisymmetric jetting collapse of air bubbles in water. This is performed for both lithotripter shock-induced collapses of initially stable bubbles, and for free-running cases where the bubble initially contains an overpressure. The code is validated using two test problems (shock-induced bubble collapse using a step shock, and shock–water column interaction) and the results are compared to numerical and experimental results. For the free-running cases, simulations are conducted for a bubble of initial radius 0.3 mm located near a rigid boundary and near an aluminium layer (planar and notched surfaces). The simulations suggest that the boundary and its distance from the bubble influence the flow dynamics, inducing bubble elongation and jetting. They also indicate stress concentration in the aluminium and the likelihood of aluminium deformation associated with bubble collapse events. For the shock-induced collapse, a lithotripter shock, consisting of 56 MPa compressive and −10 MPa tensile waves, interacts with a bubble of initial radius 0.04 mm located in a free field (case 1) and near a rigid boundary (case 2). The interaction of the shock with the bubble causes it to involute and a liquid jet is formed that achieves a velocity exceeding 1.2 km s

              for case 1 and 2.6 km s
              −1
              for case 2. The impact of the jet on the downstream wall of the bubble generates a blast wave with peak overpressure exceeding 1 GPa and 1.75 GPa for cases 1 and 2, respectively. The results show that the simulation technique retains sharply resolved gas/liquid interfaces regardless of the degree of geometric deformation, and reveal details of the dynamics of bubble collapse. The effects of compressibility are included for both liquid and gas phases, whereas stress distributions can be predicted within elastic–plastic solid surfaces (both planar and notched) in proximity to cavitation events.

Although calculi are fragmented by laser induced mechanical stresses for all lithotriptors, different fragment sizes and fragmentation efficiencies have been reported. In this work the effect of the pulse duration and pulse shape on the fragmentation processes is studied. Material and Methods: Fragmentation processes are characterized on model stones and on sensing target fibers. Stone fragmentation and cavitation bubble generation are observed by video flash photography. Shock wave occurrence and strength are monitored with an hydrophone. ResuEts: For the FPDL, stone fragmentation is induced by the collapse of the large cavitation bubble formed. For the Qswitched NdYAG, fragmentation is already observed during the laser pulse, at the plasma onset, although further fragmentation can occur at the bubble collapse. For pulse durations corresponding to the alexandrite, an intermediate fragmentation regime is observed. Conclusion: For the first time the physical basis of the observed differences in the fragmentation efficiencies of current laser lithotriptors is described. For nanosecond durations the fragmentation processes are governed by plasma induced shock waves. On the contrary, for microsecond durations fragmentation is governed by cavitation. The high fragmentation efficiency of microsecond lasers is due to a high laser energy transfer into Cavitation. 0 1995 Wiley-Liss,Inc.},

As bubbles approach the antinode, they also move toward each other and either form a cluster or coalesce. In this study, the translational trajectory of two bubbles moving toward each other in an ultrasonic standing wave at 22.4 kHz was observed using an imaging system with a high-speed video camera. This allowed the speed of the approaching bubbles to be measured for much closer distances than those reported in the prior literature. The trajectory of two approaching bubbles was modeled using coupled equations of radial and translational motions, showing similar trends with the experimental results. We also indirectly measured the secondary Bjerknes force by monitoring the acceleration when bubbles are close to each other under diﬀerent acoustic pressure amplitudes. Bubbles begin to accelerate toward each other as the distance between them gets shorter, and this acceleration increases with increasing acoustic pressure. The current study provides experimental data that validates the theory on the movement of bubbles and forces acting between them in an acoustic ﬁeld that will be useful in understanding bubble coalescence in an acoustic ﬁeld.},

Time-resolved bright-field images reveal that the delivery of the pulsed laser microbeam results in the formation of a laser-induced plasma followed by shock wave emission and cavitation bubble formation. The confinement offered by the microfluidic channel constrains substantially the cavitation bubble expansion and results in significant deformation of the PDMS channel walls. To examine the cell lysis and dispersal of the cellular contents, we acquire timeresolved fluorescence images of the process in which the cells were loaded with a fluorescent dye. These fluorescence images reveal cell lysis to occur on the nanosecond to microsecond time scale by the plasma formation and cavitation bubble dynamics. Moreover, the time-resolved fluorescence images show that while the cellular contents are dispersed by the expansion of the laser-induced cavitation bubble, the flow associated with the bubble collapse subsequently re-localizes the cellular contents to a small region. This capacity of pulsed laser microbeam irradiation to achieve rapid cell lysis in microfluidic channels with minimal dilution of the cellular contents has important implications for their use in lab-on-a-chip applications.},

	abstract = {Megasonic cleaning as applied in leading edge semiconductor device manufacturing strongly relies on the phenomenon of acoustic cavitation. As the occurrence of acoustic cavitation is incorporating a multitude of interdependent effects, the amount of cavitation activity in the cleaning liquid strongly depends on the sonication conditions. It is shown that cavitation activity as measured by means of ultraharmonic cavitation noise can be signiﬁcantly enhanced when pulsed sonication is applied to a gas supersaturated liquid under traveling wave conditions. It is demonstrated that this enhancement coincides with a dramatic increase in particle removal and is therefore of great interest for megasonic cleaning applications. It is demonstrated that the optimal pulse parameters are determined by the dissolution time of the active bubbles, whereas the amount of cavitation activity depends on the ratio between pulse-off and pulse-on time as well as the applied acoustic power. The optimal pulse-off time is independent of the corresponding pulse-on time but increases signiﬁcantly with increasing gas concentration. We show that on the other hand, supersaturation is needed to enable acoustic cavitation at aforementioned conditions, but has to be kept below values, for which active bubbles cannot dissolve anymore and are therefore lost during subsequent pulses. For the applicable range of gas contents between 100\% and 130\% saturation, the optimal pulse-off time reaches values between 150 and 340 ms, respectively. Full particle removal of 78 nm-diameter silica particles at a power density of 0.67 W/cm2 is obtained for the optimal pulse-off times. The optimal pulse-off time values are derived from the dissolution time of bubbles with a radius of 3.3 lm and veriﬁed experimentally. The bubble radius used in the calculations corresponds to the linear resonance size in a 928 kHz sound ﬁeld, which demonstrates that the recycling of active bubbles is the main enhancement mechanism. The optimal choice of the pulsing conditions however is constrained by the trade-off between the effective sonication time and the desire to have a sufﬁcient amount of active bubbles at lower powers, which might be necessary if very delicate structures have to be cleaned.},

	abstract = {During optical breakdown, the energy delivered to the sample is either transmitted, reﬂected, scattered, or absorbed. Pathways for the division of the absorbed energy are the evaporation of the focal volume, the plasma radiation, and the mechanical effects such as shock wave emission and cavitation. The partition of laser energy between these channels during breakdown in water was investigated for four selected laser parameters typical for intraocular microsurgery (6-ns pulses of 1 and 10 mJ focused at an angle of 22◦, and 30-ps pulses of 50 µJ and 1 mJ focused at 14◦, all at 1064 nm). Scattering and reﬂection were found to be small compared to transmission and absorption during optical breakdown. The ratio of the shock wave energy and cavitation bubble energy was approximately constant (between 1.5:1 and 2:1). These results allowed us to perform a more comprehensive study of the inﬂuence of pulse duration (100 fs–76 ns) and focusing angle (4◦–32◦) on the energy partition by measuring only the plasma transmission and the cavitation bubble energy. The bubble energy was used as an indicator for the total amount of mechanical energy. We found that the absorption at the breakdown site ﬁrst decreases strongly with decreasing pulse duration, but increases again for τ {\textless} 3 ps. The conversion of the absorbed energy into mechanical energy is ≈ 90\% with ns pulses at large focusing angles. It decreases both with decreasing focusing angle and pulse duration (to {\textless} 15\% for fs pulses). The disruptive character of plasma-mediated laser effects is therefore strongly reduced when ultrashort laser pulses are used.},

It is clearly seen that the nascent bubble is formed at the leading edge of the laser pulse proﬁle, regardless of the pulse width. Bubbles generated by a 20-ns pulse are characterized by a ﬂat-shape ﬁlled with dense matter with intense optical emission, which is in contrast to more hemispherical low-density bubbles observed under the irradiation by a 150-ns pulse. The behavior of the nascent bubbles is consistent with the behavior of the later plasma in the bubbles, which is crucial for observation of well-deﬁned atomic spectral lines for underwater LIBS.},

	abstract = {Histotripsy is an ultrasound ablation method that depends on the initiation of a cavitation bubble cloud to fractionate soft tissue. Although previous work has provided significant insight into the process of intrinsic threshold histotripsy, the majority of these studies have used highly focused (i.e. f-number  {\textless}  0.6) transducers. In this study, we investigate the effects of f-number on the histotripsy intrinsic threshold and cavitation bubble cloud behavior using a 500 kHz array transducer, with the effective f-number of the transducer varied from 0.51 to 0.89. The intrinsic threshold did not significantly change with f-number, with the threshold remaining {\textasciitilde}27–30 MPa for all conditions. The predictability of intrinsic threshold histotripsy was further demonstrated by experiments comparing the predicted and experimentally measured bubble cloud dimensions, with results showing close agreement for all f-numbers. Finally, the effects of f-number on ‘bubble density’ and tissue fractionation efficiency were investigated, with results supporting the hypothesis that the density of the bubbles within the bubble cloud significantly decreases at higher f-numbers, resulting in decreased fractionation efficiency. Overall, this study provides significant insight into the effects of f-number on intrinsic threshold histotripsy that will help to guide the development of histotripsy for specific clinical applications.},

the elastic boundary even through a water layer of 0.35 mm thickness. The jetting 
behaviour arises from the interaction between the counteracting forces induced by 
the rebound of the elastic boundary and the Bjerknes attraction force towards the

which allow the interpretation of the complex dynamics. The concept of the Kelvin 
impulse is examined with regard to bubble migration and jet formation. The results 
are discussed with respect to cavitation erosion, collateral damage in laser surgery,

	abstract = {In this paper, the energy conservation approach presented by Louisnard (2010) [1] for bubbly liquid is modiﬁed by applying the Keller–Miksis Equation (KME) on the radial dynamics of cavitation bubbles. As the sound wave is damped through the liquid due to thermal, viscous and radiation effects, it cannot propagate over long distances. With the use of the Rayleigh–Plesset Equation (RPE) in the energy conservation approach, the part of the damping due to the acoustic radiation is neglected. However, it should be taken into account as noticed in the aforementioned reference. Here, it is shown that this damping is of importance especially above the Blake threshold. Furthermore, the thermal damping is calculated by a new formulation. The method is based on the effect of temperature gradient at the thermal boundary layer around the bubble surface on the gas pressure inside the bubble. Results show that the power dissipated by acoustic radiation has the same order of magnitude as the thermal one and cannot be neglected. Moreover, it is revealed that the rate of change of different energies which contribute in bubble oscillation, can result in damping of the wave as secondary effects. It is observed that the thermal damping has stronger effect on the pressure wave than the viscous one. Considering the compressibility of the liquid to the ﬁrst order of the acoustical Mach number causes an increase in the thermal damping by a factor of about two to three for acoustic pressure amplitudes higher than the Blake threshold. Besides that, considering the compressibility has negligible effects on viscous damping.},

            This study is focused on exploring the feasibility of an all-optic surface scanning method in determining the size and position of a submerged, laser generated, optoacoustic (OA) source. The optoacoustic effect in this case was generated when the absorption of a short electromagnetic pulse in matter caused a dielectric breakdown, a plasma emission flash and a subsequent acoustic wave. In the experiment, a laser pulse with λ = 1064 nm and 12 ns pulse length was aimed at a volume of deionized water. When the laser beam was focused by a f = 16 mm lens, a single dielectric breakdown spot occurred. When a f = 40 mm was used several breakdowns in a row were induced. The breakdowns were photographed using a double shutter camera. The acoustic wave generated by the dielectric breakdowns were detected at a point on the water surface using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). First, the LDV signal was used to calculate the speed of sound with an accuracy of 10 m/s. Secondly, the location and length of the dielectric breakdown was calculated with an accuracy of 1 mm. The calculated position matched the breakdown location recorded by a camera. The results show that it is possible to use LDV surface measurements from a single spot to determine both the position and length of the OA source as well as the speed of sound in the medium. Furthermore, the LDV measurements also show a secondary peak that originates from the OA source. To unravel the origin and properties of this interesting feature, further investigations are necessary},

High-speed shadowgraphic imaging at 5 Â 106 frames per second, 10 ns temporal resolution and 256 frames per sequence, records the bubble deﬂation from maximum to minimum radius, the collapse and shock wave generation, and the subsequent rebound in unprecedented detail, for a single sequence of an individual bubble. The Gilmore equation for bubble oscillation is solved according to the resolved bubble collapse, and simulated shock wave proﬁles deduced from the acoustic emissions, for comparison to the hydrophone recordings. The effects of single-frequency calibration, magnitude-only and full waveform deconvolution of the experimental data are presented, in both time and frequency domains. Magnitude-only deconvolution increases the peak pressure amplitude of the measured shock wave by approximately 9\%, from single-frequency calibration, with full waveform deconvolution increasing it by a further 3\%. Full waveform deconvolution generates a shock wave proﬁle that is in agreement with the simulated proﬁle, ﬁltered according to the calibration bandwidth. Implications for the detection and monitoring of acoustic cavitation, where the role of periodic bubble collapse shock waves has recently been realised, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The correlation in spatial intensity distribution between volumetric oscillation of multibubble and sonochemiluminescence in an ultrasonic standing-wave ﬁeld is investigated through the measurements of scattered light from bubbles by changing the measuring position in the direction of sound propagation and sonochemiluminescence with luminol. When a thin light sheet, ﬁner than half the wavelength of sound, is introduced into the cavitation bubbles at the anti-node of the sound pressure, the scattered light intensity oscillates temporally. The peak-to-peak light intensity corresponds to the number of the bubbles which contribute to the sonochemical reaction because the radius for oscillating bubbles at pressure antinode is restrictive in a certain range due to the shape instability and the action of Bjerknes force that expels from anti-node bubbles larger than the resonant size. The experimental results show that at the side near the water surface, the peak-to-peak light intensity is larger in comparison with the intensity near the sound source, and this tendency becomes apparent at higher input power. These light scattering results correspond with the spatial intensity distribution of the sonochemiluminescence with luminol. Therefore, it is interpreted that most of the cavitation bubbles contributing to the sonochemical reactions in the standing wave ﬁeld exist near liquid surface. Present method of light scattering in reference with the image of the sonochemiluminescence is promising for evaluating spatial distribution of violently oscillating cavitation bubbles effective for sonochemical reactions.},

              We numerically investigate both single and multiple droplet dissolution with droplets consisting of less dense liquid dissolving in a denser host liquid. In this situation, buoyancy can lead to convection and thus plays an important role in the dissolution process. The significance of buoyancy is quantified by the Rayleigh number
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              , which is the buoyancy force over the viscous damping force. In this study,

              spans almost four decades from 0.1 to 400. We focus on how the mass flux, characterized by the Sherwood number

              , and the flow morphologies depend on 
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              . For single droplet dissolution, we first show the transition of the
              
                
                  
                  \$Sh(Ra)\$
                
              
              scaling from a constant value to

              , which confirms the experimental results by Dietrich
              et al.
               (
              J. Fluid Mech.
              , vol. 794, 2016, pp. 45–67). The two distinct regimes, namely the diffusively and the convectively dominated regimes, exhibit different flow morphologies: when
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra{\textbackslash}geqslant 10\$
                
              
              , a buoyant plume is clearly visible, which contrasts sharply with the pure diffusion case at low
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              . For multiple droplet dissolution, the well-known shielding effect comes into play at low
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              , so that the dissolution rate is slower as compared to the single droplet case. However, at high
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              , convection becomes more and more dominant so that a collective plume enhances the mass flux, and remarkably the multiple droplets dissolve faster than a single droplet. This has also been found in the experiments by Laghezza
              et al.
               (
              Soft Matt.
              , vol. 12 (26), 2016, pp. 5787–5796). We explain this enhancement by the formation of a single, larger plume rather than several individual plumes. Moreover, there is an optimal
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              at which the enhancement is maximized, because the single plume is narrower at larger
              
                
                  
                  \$Ra\$
                
              
              , which thus hinders the enhancement. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism in collective droplet dissolution, which is the merging of the plumes, which leads to non-trivial phenomena, contrasting the shielding effect.},

The shortlived ({\textless}20 µs) bubble with a maximum size of 45 µm is created in an aqueous solution with a laser pulse. Translation, rotation, and radial motion of the nanowire can be selectively achieved by varying the initial distance and orientation of the bubble with respect to the nanowire. Depending on the initial distance, the nanowire can be either pushed away or pulled toward the laser focus. No translation is observed for a distance further than approximately 60 µm, while at closer distance, the nanowire can be bent as a result of the fast ﬂow induced during the bubble collapse. Studying the dynamics of the shape recovery allows an estimation of the Young’s modulus of the nanowire. The low measured Young’s modulus (in a range from 9.6 to 13.0 GPa) of the Co nanowire is attributed to a softening effect due to structural defects and surface oxidation layer. Our study suggests that this bubble-based technique allows selectively transporting, orienting, and probing individual nanowires and may be exploited for constructing functional nanodevices.},

Viscosity and compressibility in the liquid are neglected. Two specific cases of initially spherical bubbles collapsing near a plane solid wall were simulated: a bubble initially in contact with the wall, and a bubble initially half its radius from the wall at the closest point. It is shown that the bubble develops a jet directed towards the wall rather early in the collapse history. Free surface shapes and velocities are presented at various stages in the collapse. Velocities are scaled like (Δ

The bubbles expand, reach a maximum radius and then supersonically collapse producing a by shock wave. So far, laser induced cavitation has been observed by using short pulsed (femto to nanosecond) lasers. In this report, we observe laser induced cavitation bubbles by using relatively low power (200 mW) cw light sources. A beam from a cw Nd:YAG laser (λ=1.064 µm) is tightly focused on saturated solution of copper nitrate salt. The large absorption coefficient at the illumination wavelength produces large thermal gradients and high peak temperatures leading to the formation of cavitation bubbles near the solution-glass interface. The collapse of the bubbles is so violent that they can be listened without any special device. Cavitation appears at quite regular time escales. The frequency of bubble formation depends on the laser intensity reaching frequencies as high as 4 KHz. We present detailed experimental results on the bubble formation using a phase contrast, light scattering and hydrophones.},

the material surface. Therefore, it is essential for the damaging effect
 that bubbles are 
accelerated towards the boundary during the collapse phases due to Bjerknes
 forces. 
The bubble touches the boundary at the moment of second collapse when γ{\textless}2
 and 
at the moment of first collapse when γ{\textless}1. Indentations on an aluminium
 specimen 
are found at the contact locations of the collapsing bubble. In the range
 γ=1.7 to 2, 
where the bubble collapses mainly down to a single point, one pit below
 the bubble 
centre is observed. At γ[les     ]1.7, the bubble shape has become toroidal,
 induced by 
the jet flow through the bubble centre. Corresponding to the decay of this
 bubble 
torus into multiple tiny bubbles each collapsing separately along the circumference
 
of the torus, the observed damage is circular as well. Bubbles in the ranges
 γ[les     ]0.3 
and γ=1.2 to 1.4 caused the greatest damage. The overall diameter
 of the damaged 
area is found to scale with the maximum bubble radius. Owing to the possibility
 of 
generating thousands of nearly identical bubbles, the cavitation resistance
 of even 
hard steel specimens can be tested.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is to show that the spherical shock waves arising in a liquid during cavitation bubble collapse can lead to formation of deep needle-like pits on the solid surface. The nature of dynamic damage during cavitation erosion is the spallation caused by interference of rarefaction waves. Rarefaction at spherical wave impact arises when the velocity of contact surface boundary becomes less than the speed of sound in a target. If the tension caused by the focused rarefaction wave exceeds the spall strength of material, channel spall cracks can arise. At low pulsed loading, spall cracks are formed in a dynamic fatigue mode. Needle-like damage arises upon focusing rarefaction waves. In terms of our model, a system of cylindrical spall cracks is consecutively formed around a deeper axial spall needle-like crack. Upon subsequent loading, each crack acts as a source of new rarefaction wave. Newly formed cylindrical spall cracks suppress the growth of the cracks of previous generation and give birth to the cracks of next generation. A distinctive feature is that the cracks are ﬁrst formed at the periphery of damageability zone, subsequent cracks having a lower depth.},

The lithotripter was equipped with two independently triggerable layers of piezoceramics. The front and back layers generated positive pressure amplitudes of 30 MPa and 15 MPa, respectively, and ؊10 MPa negative amplitude. The time interval between the launch of the shock waves was varied from 0 and 0.1 s, covering the regimens of pulse-modiﬁcation (regimen A, delay 0 to 4 ␮s), shock wave-cavitation cluster interaction (B, 4 ␮s to 64 ␮s) and shock wave-gas bubble interaction (C, 256 ␮s to 0.1 s). The time-integrated cavitation activity was most strongly inﬂuenced in regimen A and, in regimen B, the spatial distribution of bubbles was altered, whereas enhancement of cavitation activity was observed in regimen C. Quantitative measurements of the spatial- and time-integrated void fractions were obtained with a photographic and light-scattering technique. The preconditions for a reproducible experiment are explained, with the existence of two distinct types of cavitation nuclei, small particles suspended in the liquid and residuals of bubbles from prior cavitation clusters.

The gap height is varied, while the position of the cavitation event is ﬁxed with respect to the lower gap wall. Four diﬀerent sizes of laser-induced cavitation bubbles are studied using high-speed photography of up to 430,000 frames per second. We ﬁnd a strong inﬂuence of the gap height, H, on the bubble dynamics, in particular on the collapse scenario. Also, similar bubble dynamics was found for the same non-dimensional gap height η = H /Rx, where Rx is the maximum radius in the horizontal direction. Three scenarios are observed: neutral collapse at the gap centre, collapse onto the lower wall and collapse onto the upper wall. For intermediate gap height the bubble obtains a conical shape 1.4 {\textless} η {\textless} 7.0. For large distances, η {\textgreater} 7.0, the bubble no longer feels the presence of the upper wall and collapses hemispherically. The collapse time increases with respect to the expansion time for decreasing values of η. Due to the small scales involved, the ﬁnal stage of the bubble collapse could not be resolved temporally and numerical simulations were performed to elucidate the details of the ﬂow. The simulations demonstrate high-speed jetting towards the upper and lower walls and complex bubble splitting for neutral collapses.},

These events permitted the study of the behavior of in vivo cavitation bubbles and the subsequent tissue damage mechanism during intraocular surgery, intracorporeal and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Results were obtained with high-speed framing photography. The cavitation bubbles near the gelatin surface did not produce signiﬁcant liquid jets directed at the surface, and tended to migrate away from it. The period of the motion of a cavitation bubble near the gelatin surface was longer than that of twice the Rayleigh’s collapse time for a wide range of relative distance, L/Rmax, excepting for very small L/Rmax values (L was the standoff distance between the gelatin surface and the laser focus position, and Rmax was the maximum bubble radius). The interaction of an air bubble with a shock wave yielded a liquid jet inside the bubble, penetrating into the gelatin surface. The liquid jet had the potential to damage the gelatin. The results predicted that cavitation-bubble-induced tissue damage was closely related to the oscillatory bubble motion, the subsequent mechanical tissue displacement, and the liquid jet penetration generated by the interaction of the remaining gas bubbles with subsequent shock waves. The characteristic bubble motion and liquid jet formation depended on the tissue’s mechanical properties, resulting in different damage mechanisms from those observed on hard materials.},

Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents have been in clinical use now for more than two decades, stimulating the development of a range of new contrast-specific imaging techniques which offer substantial benefits in echocardiography, microcirculatory imaging, and more recently, quantitative and molecular imaging. In drug delivery and gene therapy, microbubbles are being investigated/developed as vehicles which can be loaded with the required therapeutic agent, traced to the target site using diagnostic ultrasound, and then destroyed with ultrasound of higher intensity energy burst to release the material locally, thus avoiding side effects associated with systemic administration, e.g. of toxic chemotherapy. It has moreover been shown that the motion of the microbubbles increases the permeability of both individual cell membranes and the endothelium, thus enhancing therapeutic uptake, and can locally increase the activity of drugs by enhancing their transport across biologically inaccessible interfaces such as blood clots or solid tumours. In high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) surgery and lithotripsy, controlled cavitation is being investigated as a means of increasing the speed and efficacy of the treatment. The aim of this paper is both to describe the key features of the physical behaviour of acoustically driven bubbles which underlie their effectiveness in biomedical applications and to review the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {The study of the interaction of bubbles with shock waves and ultrasound is sometimes termed ‘acoustic cavitation'. It is of importance in many biomedical applications where sound waves are applied. The use of shock waves and ultrasound in medical treatments is appealing because of their non-invasiveness. In this review, we present a variety of acoustics–bubble interactions, with a focus on shock wave–bubble interaction and bubble cloud phenomena. The dynamics of a single spherically oscillating bubble is rather well understood. However, when there is a nearby surface, the bubble often collapses non-spherically with a high-speed jet. The direction of the jet depends on the ‘resistance' of the boundary: the bubble jets towards a rigid boundary, splits up near an elastic boundary, and jets away from a free surface. The presence of a shock wave complicates the bubble dynamics further. We shall discuss both experimental studies using high-speed photography and numerical simulations involving shock wave–bubble interaction. In biomedical applications, instead of a single bubble, often clouds of bubbles appear (consisting of many individual bubbles). The dynamics of such a bubble cloud is even more complex. We shall show some of the phenomena observed in a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) field. The nonlinear nature of the sound field and the complex inter-bubble interaction in a cloud present challenges to a comprehensive understanding of the physics of the bubble cloud in HIFU. We conclude the article with some comments on the challenges ahead.},

	abstract = {Acoustic cavitation is the fundamental process responsible for the initiation of most of the sonochemical reactions in liquids. Acoustic cavitation originates from the interaction between sound waves and bubbles. In an acoustic ﬁeld, bubbles can undergo growth by rectiﬁed diﬀusion, bubble–bubble coalescence, bubble dissolution or bubble collapse leading to the generation of primary radicals and other secondary chemical reactions. Surface active solutes have been used in association with a number of experimental techniques in order to isolate and understand these activities. A strobe technique has been used for monitoring the growth of a single bubble by rectiﬁed diffusion. Multibubble sonoluminescence has been used for monitoring the growth of the bubbles as well as coalescence between bubbles. The extent of bubble coalescence has also been monitored using a newly developed capillary technique. An overview of the various experimental results has been presented in order to highlight the complexities involved in acoustic cavitation processes, which on the other hand arise from a simple, mechanical interaction between sound waves and bubbles.},

	abstract = {Striking the top of a liquid-filled bottle can shatter the bottom. An intuitive interpretation of this event might label an impulsive force as the culprit in this fracturing phenomenon. However, high-speed photography reveals the formation and collapse of tiny bubbles near the bottom before fracture. This observation indicates that the damaging phenomenon of cavitation is at fault. Cavitation is well known for causing damage in various applications including pipes and ship propellers, making accurate prediction of cavitation onset vital in several industries. However, the conventional cavitation number as a function of velocity incorrectly predicts the cavitation onset caused by acceleration. This unexplained discrepancy leads to the derivation of an alternative dimensionless term from the equation of motion, predicting cavitation as a function of acceleration and fluid depth rather than velocity. Two independent research groups in different countries have tested this theory; separate series of experiments confirm that an alternative cavitation number, presented in this paper, defines the universal criteria for the onset of acceleration-induced cavitation.},

With the stroboscopic technique, the time-expanded bubble motions synchronized with ultrasound wave and the real time background images can be simultaneously observed. A number of interesting phenomena resulting from the dynamic motions of a microbubble in a microspace were observed; nonspherical bubble oscillation, rectiﬁed diﬀusion, emergence of cavitation, and microstreaming of diﬀerent patterns depending on the input power of ultrasound. The observation technique described in this investigation could be a convenient tool for taming the bubble under a microscope to investigate the bubble dynamics in detail.},

A negative pressure of 61 MPa was generated following the dispersion of the compression ﬁeld at 52 MPa which was generated by the proton beam injection. It is expected that cavitation may be caused by the negative pressure. In order to evaluate the cavitation behavior and the following material damage mechanism, a simulation study was carried out using the equation of motion based on bubble dynamics for a single bubble, and fundamental parameter analysis was carried out. It is found that a bubble has a volume expansion of more than 1000 times with a change of the pressure at the window of the target vessel. Consequently wave propagation will be aﬀected. Theoretical consideration was given to the wave motion of propagation in a bubbly liquid. The equation of state in a bubbly liquid can be approximated by polynomials. The diameter of a bubble and the bubble volume fraction inherent in mercury can be estimated if the critical pressure, the sound velocity, and resonance frequency are measured by static and dynamic experiments.},

The results of Part 1 (Prosperetti \& Lezzi, 1986) are recovered at orders zero and one. At second order the ordinary inner and outer structure of the solution proves inadequate to correctly describe the fields and it is necessary to introduce an intermediate region the characteristic length of which is the geometric mean of the inner and outer lengthscales. The degree of indeterminacy for the radial equation of motion found at first order is significantly increased by going to second order. As in Part 1 we examine several of the possible forms of this equation by comparison with results obtained from the numerical integration of the complete partial-differential-equation formulation. Expressions and results for the pressure and velocity fields in the liquid are also reported.},

The spatial extent of cell lysis, cell detachment, and molecular delivery increased with laser pulse energy. Hydrodynamic analysis from time-resolved imaging studies reveal that the maximum wall shear stress associated with the pulsed laser microbeam-induced cavitation bubble expansion governs the location and spatial extent of each of these regions independent of laser pulse energy. Specifically, cells exposed to maximum wall shear stresses τw, max {\textgreater} 190 ± 20 kPa are immediately lysed while cells exposed to τw, max {\textgreater} 18 ± 2kPa are necrotic and subsequently detach. Cells exposed to τw, max in the range 8–18 kPa are viable and successfully optoporated with 3kDa Dextran molecules. Cells exposed to τw, max {\textless} 8 ± 1 kPa remain viable without molecular delivery. These findings provide the first direct correlation between pulsed laser microbeam-induced shear stresses and subsequent cellular outcome.},

The pressure is calculated using the Bernoulli equation, where the partial derivative of the potential in time is calculated using the auxiliary function method. The numerical results agree well with experimental results, in terms of bubble shape and pressure ﬁelds. There are two root causes of the bubble induced pressure and the dynamic pressure is decomposed into two parts correspondingly. The ﬁrst part pg is associated with the imbalanced pressure between the bubble gas and the ambient ﬂow, which measures the contribution of the high pressure gas to the dynamic pressure. The second part pm is caused by the bubble motion, which helps evaluate the contribution of the jet impact. The variation of pg has the same pattern with the gas pressure. pm at the wall center reaches its ﬁrst peak soon after the jet impact, and then decreases due to the reduction of jet velocity. As the toroidal bubble migrates towards the wall, pm may rise again. We also investigate the inﬂuences of dimensionless parameters on the pressure ﬁeld induced by a gas/cavitation bubble.},

An improved method for calculating the thermo-ﬂuid parameters behind shock waves is introduced in this work. Shock waves in ambient air, induced by pulsed Nd : YAG laser ablation of aluminium ﬁlms, are measured using a shadowgraph apparatus. Normal shock solutions are applied to experimental data for shock wave positions and used to calculate pressure, temperature, and velocity behind the shock wave. Non-dimensionalizing the pressure and temperature with respect to the ambient values, the dimensionless pressure and temperature are estimated to be as high as 90 and 16, respectively, at a time of 10 ns after the ablation pulse for a laser ﬂuence of F = 14.5 J cm−2. The results of the normal shock solution and the Taylor–Sedov similarity solution are compared to show that the Taylor–Sedov solution under-predicts pressure when the Mach number of the shock wave is small. At a ﬂuence of 3.1 J cm−2, the shock wave Mach number is less than 3, and the Taylor–Sedov solution under-predicts the non-dimensional pressure by as much as 45\%.},

The model is augmented to include expressions for a variable polytropic exponent, hardcore and water vapour. Radiated acoustic energies are calculated within a quasi-acoustic approximation and also a shock wave model. Isoenergy lines are shown for driving frequencies of 23.5 kHz and 1 MHz. Together with calculations of stability against surface wave oscillations leading to fragmentation, the physically relevant parameter space for the bubble radii is found. Its upper limit is around 6 μm for the lower frequency driving and 1–3 μm for the higher. The radiated acoustic energy of a single bubble driven in the kilohertz range is calculated to be of the order of 100 nJ per driving period; a bubble driven in the megahertz range reaches two orders of magnitude less. The results for the first have applications in sonoluminescence research. Megahertz frequencies are widely used in wafer cleaning, where radiated sound may be implicated as responsible for the damage of nanometre-sized structures.},

	abstract = {Contactless manipulation of microparticles using acoustic waves holds promise for applications ranging from cell sorting to three-dimensional (3D) printing and tissue engineering. However, the unique potential of acoustic trapping to be applied in biomedical settings remains largely untapped. In particular, the main advantage of acoustic trapping over optical trapping, namely the ability of sound to propagate through thick and opaque media, has not yet been exploited in full. Here we demonstrate experimentally the use of the recently developed technique of single-beam acoustical tweezers to trap microbubbles, an important class of biomedically relevant microparticles. We show that the region of vanishing pressure of a propagating vortex beam can confine a microbubble by forcing low-amplitude, nonspherical, shape oscillations, enabling its full 3D positioning. Our interpretation is validated by the absolute calibration of the acoustic trapping force and the direct spatial mapping of isolated bubble echos, for which both find excellent agreement with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we prove the stability of the trap through centimeter-thick layers of bio-mimicking, elastic materials. Finally, we demonstrate the simultaneous trapping of nanoparticle-loaded microbubbles and activation with an independent acoustic field to trigger the release of the nanoparticles. Overall, using exclusively acoustic powering to position and actuate microbubbles paves the way toward controlled delivery of drug payloads in confined, hard-to-reach locations, with potential in vivo applications.},

The bubble motion may, however, be in the low Mach number ﬂow regime when the bubble is near the maximum size at the early stage and at its full rebound. Although it is quite well known that a compressible ﬂow solver encounters difﬁculties in the low Mach number regime, the inﬂuence of the low Mach number on the simulation of bubble collapse and rebound is not clear. In the present work, an axisymmetric compressible solver based on the acoustic Riemann solver is used to simulate the dynamics of bubble motion. The artiﬁcial viscosity terms in the Riemann solver are rescaled for the low Mach regime by following the concept of numerical sound speed, which was originally developed in the AUSM family scheme. The numerical results are compared with the solutions of the Rayleigh model for bubble collapse and the Keller–Miksis model for bubble collapse and rebound. It is found that the low Mach number scaling improves the accuracy of the size of a collapsing bubble considerably.},

	abstract = {The steady liquid ﬂow observed under ultrasonic emitters generating acoustic cavitation can be successfully predicted by a standard turbulent ﬂow calculation. The ﬂow is driven by the classical averaged volumetric force density calculated from the acoustic ﬁeld, but the inertial term in Navier–Stokes equations must be kept, and a turbulent solution must be sought. The acoustic ﬁeld must be computed with a realistic model, properly accounting for dissipation by the cavitation bubbles [Louisnard, Ultrason. Sonochem., 19, (2012) 56-65]. Comparison with 20 kHz experiments, involving the combination of acoustic streaming and a perpendicular forced ﬂow in a duct, shows reasonably good agreement. Moreover, the persistence of the cavitation effects on the wall facing the emitter, in spite of the deﬂection of the streaming jet, is correctly reproduced by the model. It is also shown that predictions based either on linear acoustics with the correct turbulent solution, or with Louisnard’s model with Eckart–Nyborg’s theory yields unrealistic results.},

	abstract = {In a companion paper, a reduced model for propagation of acoustic waves in a cloud of inertial cavitation bubbles was proposed. The wave attenuation was calculated directly from the energy dissipated by a single bubble, the latter being estimated directly from the fully nonlinear radial dynamics. The use of this model in a mono-dimensional conﬁguration has shown that the attenuation near the vibrating emitter was much higher than predictions obtained from linear theory, and that this strong attenuation creates a large traveling wave contribution, even for closed domain where standing waves are normally expected. In this paper, we show that, owing to the appearance of traveling waves, the primary Bjerknes force near the emitter becomes very large and tends to expel the bubbles up to a stagnation point. Twodimensional axi-symmetric computations of the acoustic ﬁeld created by a large area immersed sonotrode are also performed, and the paths of the bubbles in the resulting Bjerknes force ﬁeld are sketched. Cone bubble structures are recovered and compare reasonably well to reported experimental results. The underlying mechanisms yielding such structures is examined, and it is found that the conical structure is generic and results from the appearance a sound velocity gradient along the transducer area. Finally, a more complex system, similar to an ultrasonic bath, in which the sound ﬁeld results from the ﬂexural vibrations of a thin plate, is also simulated. The calculated bubble paths reveal the appearance of other commonly observed structures in such conﬁgurations, such as streamers and ﬂare structures.},

A two-dimensional impact geometry is used to enable processes occurring inside the cavities such as jet motion, as well as the movement of the liquid around the cavities, to be observed. The cavity arrangements are produced by first casting water/gelatine sheets and then forming circular holes, or other desired shapes, in the gelatine layer. The gelatine layer is placed between two thick glass blocks and the array of cavities is then collapsed by a shock wave, visualized using schlieren photography and produced from an impacting projectile. A major advantage of the technique is that cavity size, shape, spacing and number can be accurately controlled. Furthermore, the shape of the shock wave and also its orientation relative to the cavities can be varied. The results are compared with proposed interaction mechanisms for the collapse of pairs of cavities, rows of cavities and clusters of cavities. Shocks of kbar (0.1 GPa) strength produced jets of

	abstract = {Underwater explosions present many challenges for numerical modeling. The density ratio between explosion gases and the surrounding liquid are typically Oð103Þ, and the pressure ratios can be just as high. We develop a cell-centered ﬁnite volume method to solve the governing equations of a two-phase homogeneous ﬂuid. Isentropic and isothermal equations of state are used to relate densities and pressure, in lieu of solving an energy equation. A volume fraction is used to distinguish between the disparate phases. A pressure-based, segregated algebraic solution procedure is used to solve for the primitive variables representing volume fraction, velocity, and piezometric pressure. Numerical examples include veriﬁcation and validation for a number of canonical test cases. In particular, we examine an advecting material interface and show the absence of pressure oscillations across the contact discontinuity. The non-conservative form of our equations does not guarantee exact mass balance, but numerical experiments indicate that this dissipative mechanism has a stabilizing affect on the method. Shock tube and axisymmetric underwater explosion problems are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm when very large density and pressure discontinuities are present. We simulate a shallow water explosion in three dimensions and examine the effects on the free surface and explosion bubble topology. Ó 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The bubbles involved in sonochemistry and other applications of cavitation oscillate inertially. A correct estimation of the wave attenuation in such bubbly media requires a realistic estimation of the power dissipated by the oscillation of each bubble, by thermal diffusion in the gas and viscous friction in the liquid. Both quantities and calculated numerically for a single inertial bubble driven at 20 kHz, and are found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the linear prediction. Viscous dissipation is found to be the predominant cause of energy loss for bubbles small enough. Then, the classical nonlinear Caﬂish equations describing the propagation of acoustic waves in a bubbly liquid are recast and simpliﬁed conveniently. The main harmonic part of the sound ﬁeld is found to fulﬁll a nonlinear Helmholtz equation, where the imaginary part of the squared wave number is directly correlated with the energy lost by a single bubble. For low acoustic driving, linear theory is recovered, but for larger drivings, namely above the Blake threshold, the attenuation coefﬁcient is found to be more than 3 orders of magnitude larger then the linear prediction. A huge attenuation of the wave is thus expected in regions where inertial bubbles are present, which is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Helmholtz equation in a 1D standing wave conﬁguration. The expected strong attenuation is not only observed but furthermore, the examination of the phase between the pressure ﬁeld and its gradient clearly demonstrates that a traveling wave appears in the medium.},

shock waves in condensed multiphase mixtures, homogeneous two-phase flows (bubbly

of the formulation to an arbitrary number of fluids, and to mass and energy transfers, 
and extend the associated Godunov method.
            We first detail the specific problems involved in the computation of thermodynamic 
interface variables when dealing with compressible materials separated by well-defined 
interfaces. We then address one of the major problems in the modelling of detonation 
waves in condensed energetic materials and propose a way to suppress the mixture 
equation of state. We then consider another problem of practical importance related 
to high-pressure liquid injection and associated cavitating flow. This problem involves 
the dynamic creation of interfaces. We show that the multiphase model is able to 
solve these very different problems using a unique formulation.
            We then develop the Godunov method for this model. We show how the non-conservative 
terms must be discretized in order to fulfil the interface conditions. 
Numerical resolution of interface conditions and partial equilibrium multiphase 
mixtures also requires the introduction of infinite relaxation terms. We propose a way 
to solve them in the context of an arbitrary number of fluids. This is of particular 
importance for the development of multimaterial reactive hydrocodes. We finally extend 
the discretization method in the multidimensional case, and show some results

            The combination of ultrasound and microreactor is an emerging and promising area, but the report of designing high-power ultrasonic microreactor (USMR) is still limited. This work presents a robust, high-power and highly efficient USMR by directly coupling a microreactor plate with a Langevin-type transducer. The USMR is designed as a longitudinal half wavelength resonator, for which the antinode plane of the highest sound intensity is located at the microreactor. According to one dimension design theory, numerical simulation and impedance analysis, a USMR with a maximum power of 100 W and a resonance frequency of 20 kHz was built. The strong and uniform sound field in the USMR was then applied to intensify gas–liquid mass transfer of slug flow in a microfluidic channel. Non-inertial cavitation with multiple surface wave oscillation was excited on the slug bubbles, enhancing the overall mass transfer coefficient by 3.3–5.7 times.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic effects associated with the growth and collapse of a single cavitation bubble are investigated in the present paper by an experimental approach. The study focuses on the temperature variations in the liquid surrounding the bubble. Experiments are conducted in a cylinder partially filled with water at an ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The bubble growth results from the expansion of an initial air bubble, due to the pressure wave generated by a so-called ‘tube-arrest' method. Several locations of the bubble, at different distances from the bottom wall of the cylinder, are considered. The bottom wall is made of sapphire, which is transparent to both the visible and infrared light spectra which enables temperature measurements by a high-speed thermovision camera at a wavelength of 3– . Water is opaque to the infrared light spectrum, hence only temperatures in the boundary layer and on the liquid vapour interface could be determined. A temperature decrease of K was recorded during the bubble growth while an increase up to 4 K was detected during the collapse. Experimental results are compared to the predictions of the ‘thermal delay' model based on the assumption that the bubble growth and collapse are due to phase changes only. In this approach, the temperature variations are related to the latent heat exchanges during the vapourization and condensation processes. On the basis of these results, the respective effects of phase change and air dilatation/compression in the bubble dynamics are discussed.},

	abstract = {The use of bubbles in applications such as surface chemistry, drug delivery, and ultrasonic cleaning etc. has been enormously popular in the past two decades. It has been recognized that acoustically-driven bubbles can be used to disturb the ﬂow ﬁeld near a boundary in order to accelerate physical or chemical reactions on the surface. The interactions between bubbles and a surface have been studied experimentally and analytically. However, most of the investigations focused on violently oscillating bubbles (also known as cavitation bubble), less attention has been given to understand the interactions between moderately oscillating bubbles and a boundary. Moreover, cavitation bubbles were normally generated in situ by a high intensity laser beam, little experimental work has been carried out to study the translational trajectory of a moderately oscillating bubble in an acoustic ﬁeld and subsequent interactions with the surface. This paper describes the design of an ultrasonic test cell and explores the mechanism of bubble manipulation within the test cell. The test cell consists of a transducer, a liquid medium and a glass backing plate. The acoustic ﬁeld within the multi-layered stack was designed in such a way that it was effectively one dimensional. This was then successfully simulated by a one dimensional network model. The model can accurately predict the impedance of the test cell as well as the mode shape (distribution of particle velocity and stress/pressure ﬁeld) within the whole assembly. The mode shape of the stack was designed so that bubbles can be pushed from their injection point onto a backing glass plate. Bubble radial oscillation was simulated by a modiﬁed Keller–Miksis equation and bubble translational motion was derived from an equation obtained by applying Newton’s second law to a bubble in a liquid medium. Results indicated that the bubble trajectory depends on the acoustic pressure amplitude and initial bubble size: an increase of pressure amplitude or a decrease of bubble size forces bubbles larger than their resonant size to arrive at the target plate at lower heights, while the trajectories of smaller bubbles are less inﬂuenced by these factors. The test cell is also suitable for testing the effects of drag force on the bubble motion and for studying the bubble behavior near a surface.},

This paper aims at the theoretical study of various aspects of the translational motion of a spherical gas bubble in a high-frequency standing wave. In particular, it is shown that the translational instability that gives rise to the reciprocal translation of a spherical bubble between the pressure antinode and the pressure node is caused by the hysteresis in the main resonance of the bubble. Different types of translational trajectories that can occur in a standing wave are illustrated by numerical simulations. A general classiﬁcation of the observed translational trajectories is proposed.},

Dielectric breakdown with plasma and bubble formation, the breakdown shock wave, bubble dynamics with expansion and collapse, and the bubble collapse shock wave or waves are addressed. Breakdown plasma lengths as a function of laser pulse energy are given. The propagation speed of the breakdown shock wave and the related shock peak pressure as determined by high speed streak recordings for nano-, pico-, and femtosecond laser pulses focused into water are discussed. Breakdown shock wave velocities up to 5000 m/s and peak pressures up to 100 kbar are reported for these monopolar acoustic pulses for laser pulse energies up to some 10 mJ. In tissue bipolar pressure pulses are observed due to the elasticity of the medium. The widths of the shock waves reach values in the range of tens of nano seconds to beyond 100 ns. The simultaneously generated breakdown bubble gets about half of the energy of the shock wave. Bubble energy rises linearly with the laser pulse energy with different slopes depending on the laser pulse duration. Equations for bubble dynamics are given and compared with laser induced bubble dynamics. Strength and width of bubble collapse shock waves measured with PVDF and ﬁber optic hydrophones are presented together with the breakdown shock waves. Similar values are obtained for both collapse and breakdown in the bulk of the liquid. Shock wave emission from bubbles collapsing near boundaries (solid and elastic) is discussed together with applications in cleaning and erosion or cell destruction.},

In its gravity-free reference frame, the liquid interface is deformed by surface tension into a hemispherical shape. On impact of the tube on a rigid floor, the interface curvature reverses violently, forming a concentrated jet. If the contact angle at the tube wall is such that the interface is flat, the liquid rebounds as a whole with the tube, with no deformation. We analyse this phenomenon using an impulse pressure description, providing an exact description of the initial liquid velocity field at the impact, supported by high-speed image velocimetry measurements. This initial dynamics is insensitive to liquid surface tension and viscosity.},

This situation is found in various natural and technological contexts (geological fluid inclusions, plant cells and vessels, soil tensiometers, etc.), where such bubbles can pre-exist in the trapped liquid or appear by nucleation (cavitation). We focus on volumetric deformations and first establish the potential energy of fully confined bubbles as a function of their radius, including contributions from gas compressibility, surface tension, liquid compressibility and elastic deformation of the surrounding solid. We evaluate how the Blake threshold of unstable bubble growth is modified by confinement and we also obtain an original bubble stability phase diagram with a regime of liquid superstability (spontaneous bubble collapse) for strong confinements. We then calculate the liquid velocity field associated with radial deformations of the bubble and strain in the solid, and we predict large deviations in the kinematics compared to bubbles in extended liquids. Finally, we derive the equations governing the natural oscillation dynamics of fully confined bubbles, extending Minnaert's formula and the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, and we show that the compressibility of the liquid as well as the elasticity of the walls can result in ultra-fast bubble radial oscillations and unusually quick damping. We find excellent agreement between the predictions of our model and recent experimental results.},

Pressure measurements reveal that strong pressure variations (up to 100 atmospheres) with a rich content of frequencies are efficiently transmitted to the liquid. High-speed camera visualizations show that pre-existing millimetric bubbles always collapse during the first instants of the impact whereas the behavior of submillimetric bubbles depends on the features of the pressure evolution in the system. In addition to the impact velocity, the amount of gas/vapor trapped between the piston and the liquid's surface plays an important role on how pressure evolves. Only when negative pressure occurs tiny bubbles grow significantly and collapse. The violent collapse of bubbles promote turbulence and mixing at very small length-scales which renders this technique interesting to intensify processes limited by heat and mass diffusion. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 2483–2495, 2017.},

	abstract = {When a high-intensity laser pulse is focused into a liquid the energy is converted into mechanical energy via an optodynamic process. The conversion starts with plasma formation; this is followed by shock-wave propagation and the expansion of a cavitation bubble. A cavitation bubble developed near boundaries results in an asymmetrical collapse, with the generation of a liquid jet during the bubble's rebound. In the case of a free surface this liquid jet is directed away from the surface and the oscillation times are prolonged. On the other hand, in the case of a rigid boundary, the liquid jet is directed toward the boundary and the oscillation times are shortened. We present measurements of a cavitation bubble oscillating between a free surface and a rigid boundary using deflections of a laser beam as the optical probe. Shadow photography was used simultaneously as a comparison during the experiments. With the beam-deflection probe we also measured the shortening of the oscillation times near a free surface as well as the prolongation of oscillation times near a rigid boundary. In order to explain this shortening of the cavitation-bubble oscillation times near a free surface, Rayleigh's model was extended and compared with our experimental results. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

This study provides experimental data on the effect of a range of bubble sizes (8-30 lm), distances (60.2 mm), acoustic pressures (20-40 kPa) and frequencies (40-100 kHz) on the relative acceleration of two approaching bubbles. Under these conditions, only variations in the magnitude of the attractive force were observed. Using coupled equations of radial and translational motions, the acceleration and secondary Bjerknes force were calculated and compared to the experimental data. The variations in the magnitude of the secondary Bjerknes forces were explained by simulating bubble radius and coupled volume oscillation as a function of time.},

Here we introduce a novel approach to assess criticality that overcomes these limitations, while encompassing and generalizing previous criteria. We find a simple model to describe the global activity of large populations of ganglion cells in the rat retina, and show that their statistics are poised near a critical point. Taking into account the temporal dynamics of the activity greatly enhances the evidence for criticality, revealing it where previous methods would not.

When the bubble performs its transient resonance at the nth order harmonics of the standing waves in the liquid, the light intensity strongly depends on the amplitude of the driving pressure (proportional to its 2n power, with n = fr/f, where fr is Minnaert's linear resonant frequency of the bubble and f is the frequency of driving sound). The kinetic energy of a vibrating bubble becomes maximum approximately when it is in its equilibrium size. For example, when the ambient temperature of a bubble decreases from 34°C to 4°C, a huge increase of the light intensity emitted by it can be explained. A suggestion was made that, within the limits permitted by the phase diagrams, as high an increase in driving pressure as possible could enhance the light intensity of sonoluminescence up to four orders of magnitude. © 2001 Chin.

	abstract = {We report visual observation of a sound-induced bubble in superﬂuid 3He–4He liquid mixtures using a high-speed camera at a rate of 1 msec/frame. The experiments were performed in the 3He dilute phase of phase-separated mixtures at 300 mK. The resonant frequency of the piezoelectric transducer was 9.36 MHz and the diameter of the active electrode was about 4 mm. When an acoustic wave pulse of sufﬁcient magnitude was applied to the dilute phase from the transducer under saturated vapor pressure, a single bubble was nucleated on the active area. The bubble expanded almost spherically on the transducer, as it reached maximum size, it started shrinking, detached from the transducer, and collapsed. We also investigated the motion of the bubble in mixtures with a 3He concentration of 25\% at 750 mK. In this case, the bubble grew elliptically on the transducer and detached from it without much change in shape.},

Ultrasound at 20 kHz was applied to a cross-ﬂow ﬁltration system with g-alumina membranes in the presence of colloidal silica particles. Experimental results indicated that particle concentration affected the ability of ultrasound to control membrane fouling, with less effective control of fouling at higher particle concentrations. Measurements of sound wave intensity and images of the cavitation region indicated that particles induced additional cavitation bubbles near the ultrasonic source, which resulted in less turbulence reaching the membrane surface and subsequently less effective control of fouling. When silica particles were modiﬁed to be hydrophobic, greater inducement of cavitation bubbles near the ultrasonic source occurred for a ﬁxed concentration, also resulting in less effective control of fouling. Particle size inﬂuenced the cleaning ability of ultrasound, with better permeate recovery observed with larger particles. Particle size did not affect sound wave intensity, suggesting that the more effective control of fouling by large particles was due to greater lift and cross-ﬂow drag forces on larger particles compared to smaller particles.},

Increasing the ﬁltration pressure increased the compressive forces driving cavitation collapse and resulted in fewer cavitation bubbles absorbing and scattering sound waves and increasing sound wave penetration. However, an increased ﬁltration pressure also resulted in greater permeation drag, and subsequently less improvement in permeate ﬂux compared to low ﬁltration pressure. Finally, pulsed ultrasound with short pulse intervals resulted in permeate ﬂux improvement close to that of continuous sonication.},

	abstract = {Cavitation in thin layer of liquid metal has potential applications in chemical reaction, soldering, extraction, and therapeutic equipment. In this work, the cavitation characteristics and acoustic pressure of a thin liquid Ga–In alloy were studied by high speed photography, numerical simulation, and bubble dynamics calculation. A selfmade ultrasonic system with a TC4 sonotrode, was operated at a frequency of 20 kHz and a max output power of 1000 W during the cavitation recording experiment. The pressure field characteristic inside the thin liquid layer and its influence on the intensity, types, dimensions, and life cycles of cavitation bubbles and on the cavitation evolution process against experimental parameters were systematically studied. The results showed that acoustic pressure inside the thin liquid layer presented alternating positive and negative characteristics within 1 acoustic period (T). Cavitation bubbles nucleated and grew during the negative-pressure stage and shrank and collapsed during the positive-pressure stage. A high bubble growth speed of 16.8 m/s was obtained and evidenced by bubble dynamics calculation. The maximum absolute pressure was obtained at the bottom of the thin liquid layer and resulted in the strongest cavitation. Cavitation was divided into violent and weak stages. The violent cavitation stage lasted several hundreds of acoustic periods and had higher bubble intensity than the weak cavitation stage. Cavitation cloud preferentially appeared during the violent cavitation stage and had a life of several acoustic periods. Tiny cavitation bubbles with life cycles shorter than 1 T dominated the cavitation field. High cavitation intensities were observed at high ultrasonication power and when Q235B alloy was used because such conditions lead to high amplitudes on the substrate and further high acoustic pressure inside the liquid.},

Herein, a method is proposed to realize the reversible switching between underwater superaerophilicity and superaerophobicity on the femtosecond laser-induced rough polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface by controlling the trapped air layer in water. The original femtosecond laser-structured PTFE surface is superhydrophobic in air and superaerophilic in water. After vacuum-pumping treatment, the trapped air layer around the microstructures of the underwater superhydrophobic PTFE surface is removed, leading to the underwater superaerophobicity of the sample surface. The trapped air layer can be recovered and the PTFE surface can regain the underwater superaerophilicity by drying treatment and the immersion of the sample in water again. Such a round-trip transition can achieve the bubble's “locating capture” and the control of the selective passage of air bubbles through a perforated rough PTFE sheet. It is believed that the resultant underwater superaerophobic and superaerophilic surfaces will have significant applications in manufacturing submarine gas-collection devices, improving the chemical reaction between liquid reagent and gas, and avoiding the microchannel blockage caused by bubbles in microfluidics and biosensor devices.},

In addition, stone phantoms were used to compare the fragmentation efficiency of various laser and electrohydraulic lithotripters. The pulsed-dye laser, with a wavelength (504 nm) strongly absorbed by most stone materials but not by water, and a short pulse duration of I ¿¿sec, induces plasma formation on the surface of the target calculi. Subsequently, the rapid expansion of the plasma forms a cavitation bubble, which expands spherically to a maximum size and then collapses violently, leading to strong Shockwave generation and microjet impingement, which comprises the primary mechanism for stone fragmentation with short-pulse lasers. In contrast, the holmium laser, with a wavelength (2100 nm) most strongly absorbed by water as well as by all stone materials and a long pulse duration of 250 to 350 /isec, produces an elongated, pear-shaped cavitation bubble at the tip of the optical fiber that forms a vapor channel to conduct the ensuing laser energy to the target stone (Moss effect). The expansion and subsequent collapse of the elongated bubble is asymmetric, resulting in weak Shockwave generation and microjet impingement. Thus, stone fragmentation in holmium laser lithotripsy is caused primarily by thermal ablation (drilling effect).},

The maximum cavity radius and the shock wave zone are shown to scale as the cube root of the pump pulse energy over almost three orders of magnitude. For pulse energies close to the threshold energy of 8 pJ, the shock range was {\textasciitilde} 100-200 gm and the cavity radius was 140 gm. Complementary experiments were performed with 10-ns pulse durations. Since picosecond pulses have high peak intensities with low pulse energies, a significant enhancement in localizability may be achieved. The implications for ophthalmic microsurgery are discussed.},

The simple study also yields the threshold dependence on pulse duration and input spot size, thus providing a framework to view the results of numerical simulations of the full model. The simulations establish the breakdown threshold in input power and reveal qualitatively different behavior for picoand femto-second pulses.

The acoustic radiation force is known to be static for a continuous wave and is used for many applications. This force can also be dynamic (oscillatory) if the incident sound wave-ﬁeld is modulated (slow time-variations). The purpose of the present paper is to develop the theory for the dynamic radiation force on spheres and cylinders immersed in ideal ﬂuids and placed in a plane standing wave-ﬁeld. It is assumed that the amplitude-modulated ﬁeld is produced by dual-frequency plane wave beams propagating along the same direction. Analytical solutions and equations for the dynamic components of the force are derived. Explicit numerical calculations are presented for elastic spheres and cylinders, and rigid and ﬂuid spheres, as well as air bubbles in water. The equations provide analytical radiation force dependencies on the acoustic ﬁeld and medium parameters. Results show a new dynamic effect in the radiation force functions’ curves that results in the splitting of the resonance peaks as long as the modulation frequency increases. It is shown that the radiation force has slow time variations and cannot be treated as a steady-state phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Vapour cavities in liquid flows have long been associated with
 cavitation damage to 
nearby solid surfaces and it is thought that the final stage of collapse,
 when a high-
speed liquid jet threads the cavity, plays a vital role in this process.
 The present study 
investigates this aspect of the motion of laser-generated cavities in a
 quiescent liquid 
when the distance (or stand-off) of the point of inception from a rigid
 boundary is 
between 0.8 and 1.2 times the maximum radius of the cavity.
 Numerical simulations 
using a boundary integral method with an incompressible liquid impact model
 provide 
a framework for the interpretation of the experimental results. It is observed
 that, 
within the given interval of the stand-off parameter, the peak pressures
 measured on 
the boundary at the first collapse of a cavity attain a local minimum,
 while at the 
same time there is an increase in the duration of the pressure pulse. This
 contrasts 
with a monotonic increase in the peak pressures as the stand-off is reduced,
 when 
the cavity inception point is outside the stated interval. This phenomenon
 is shown 
to be due to a splash effect which follows the impact of the liquid jet.
 Three cases 
are chosen to typify the splash interaction with the free surface of the
 collapsing 
cavity: (i) surface reconnection around the liquid jet; (ii) splash impact
 at the base 
of the liquid jet; (iii) thin film splash. Hydrodynamic pressures generated
 following 
splash impact are found to be much greater than those produced by the jet
 impact. 
The combination of splash impact and the emission of shock waves, together
 with 
the subsequent re-expansion, drives the flow around the toroidal cavity
 producing a

	abstract = {We describe a recently realized experiment producing the most spherical cavitation bubbles today. The bubbles grow inside a liquid from a point plasma generated by a nanosecond laser pulse. Unlike in previous studies, the laser is focussed by a parabolic mirror, resulting in a plasma of unprecedented symmetry. The ensuing bubbles are sufﬁciently spherical that the hydrostatic pressure gradient caused by gravity becomes the dominant source of asymmetry in the collapse and rebound of the cavitation bubbles. To avoid this natural source of asymmetry, the whole experiment is therefore performed in microgravity conditions (ESA, 53rd and 56th parabolic ﬂight campaign). Cavitation bubbles were observed in microgravity (*0 g), where their collapse and rebound remain spherical, and in normal gravity (1 g) to hyper-gravity (1.8 g), where a gravity-driven jet appears. Here, we describe the experimental setup and technical results, and overview the science data. A selection of high-quality shadowgraphy movies and time-resolved pressure data is published online.},

	abstract = {Recent clinical trials have shown the eﬃcacy of a passive acoustic device used during shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) treatment. The device uses the far-ﬁeld acoustic emissions resulting from the interaction of the therapeutic shock waves with the tissue and kidney stone to diagnose the eﬀectiveness of each shock in contributing to stone fragmentation. This paper details simulations that supported the development of that device by extending computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the ﬂow and near-ﬁeld pressures associated with shock-induced bubble collapse to allow estimation of those far-ﬁeld acoustic emissions. This is a required stage in the development of the device, because current computational resources are not suﬃcient to simulate the far-ﬁeld emissions to ranges of O(10 cm) using CFD. Similarly, they are insuﬃcient to cover the duration of the entire cavitation event, and here simulate only the ﬁrst part of the interaction of the bubble with the lithotripter shock wave in order to demonstrate the methods by which the far-ﬁeld acoustic emissions resulting from the interaction can be estimated. A free-Lagrange method (FLM) is used to simulate the collapse of initially stable air bubbles in water as a result of their interaction with a planar lithotripter shock. To estimate the far-ﬁeld acoustic emissions from the interaction, this paper developed two numerical codes using the Kirchhoﬀ and Ffowcs William–Hawkings (FW-H) formulations. When coupled to the FLM code, they can be used to estimate the far-ﬁeld acoustic emissions of cavitation events. The limitation of the technique is that it assumes that no signiﬁcant nonlinear acoustic propagation occurs outside the control surface. Methods are outlined for ameliorating this problem if, as here, computational resources cannot compute the ﬂow ﬁeld to suﬃcient distance, although for the clinical situation discussed, this limitation is tempered by the eﬀect of tissue absorption, which here is incorporated through the standard derating procedure. This approach allowed identiﬁcation of the sources of, and explanation of trends seen in, the characteristics of the far-ﬁeld emissions observed in clinic, to an extent that was suﬃcient for the development of this clinical device.},

	abstract = {Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has been successful for more than twenty years in treating patients with kidney stones. Hundreds of underwater shock waves are generated outside the patient’s body and focused on the kidney stone. Stones fracture mainly due to spalling, cavitation and layer separation. Cavitation bubbles are produced in the vicinity of the stone by the tensile phase of each shock wave. Bubbles expand, stabilize and ﬁnally collapse violently, creating stone-damaging secondary shock waves and microjets. Bubble collapse can be intensiﬁed by sending a second shock wave a few hundred microseconds after the ﬁrst. A novel method of generating two piezoelectrically generated shock waves with an adjustable time delay between 50 and 950 µs is described and tested. The objective is to enhance cavitation-induced damage to kidney stones during ESWL in order to reduce treatment time. In vitro kidney stone model fragmentation efﬁciency and pressure measurements were compared with those for a standard ESWL system. Results indicate that fragmentation efﬁciency was signiﬁcantly enhanced at a shock wave delay of about 400 and 250 µs using rectangular and spherical stone phantoms, respectively. The system presented here could be installed in clinical devices at relatively low cost, without the need for a second shock wave generator.},

This review discusses two super-resolution imaging techniques, structured illumination microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence or microscopy, which can visualize bulk and interfacial flows, respectively, at spatial resolutions below the classic diffraction limits. First, we discuss the theory and applications of structured illumination for optical sectioning, i.e., imaging a thin slice of a flow illuminated over its entire volume. Structured illumination can be used to visualize the interior of multiphase flows such as sprays by greatly reducing secondary scattering. Second, the theory underlying evanescent waves is introduced, followed by a review of how total internal reflection microscopy has been used to visualize interfacial flows over the last 15 years. Both techniques, which are starting to be used in fluid mechanics, could significantly improve quantitative imaging of microscale and macroscale flows.},

At this stage the edge pressures, for both spherical drops and two-dimensional liquid wedges, depend only on the impact velocity and the instantaneous angle between the liquid and solid surfaces. This suggests that the essential features of the early stage of liquid impact can be usefully studied by producing impacts with two-dimensional liquid wedges, and predicted data for pressures, shock angles and velocities are presented. Experiments are described for producing impacts with preformed shapes by using water-gelatine mixtures and observing the impact events with high-speed photography. The results confirm the main features of the model and give information on edge pressures, jetting, cavitation in the liquid and the effect of the admittance of the solid. The relevance of the results to the damage and erosion of materials subjected to liquid impact is discussed. In particular, it is possible to explain the apparently low damage-threshold of some materials, the form of damage and its development with repeated impact. The study highlights the importance of the detailed surface geometry in the region of contact.},

We hypothesize that cavitation is a physical mechanism that underlies the increase in Ca2+ in these experiments. To control the presence of cavitation, the wave type was controlled in a sonication chamber. One wave type largely contained a traveling wave (wave type A) while the other wave type largely contained a standing wave (wave type B). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of a sound ﬁeld produced by the wave types ascertained that stable cavitation was present only under wave type A ultrasound irradiation. Under the two controlled wave types, the increase in Ca2+ in L929 ﬁbroblasts was observed with ﬂuorescence imaging. Under wave type A ultrasound irradiation, an increase in Ca2+ was observed; however, no increase in Ca2+ was observed under wave type B ultrasound irradiation. We conclude that stable cavitation is involved in the increase of Ca2+ in cells subjected to pulsed ultrasound.},

	abstract = {The propagation of ultrasound through a liquid induces the growth of inceptions and germs into bubbles. In a low frequency reactor, fragmentary transient bubbles emerge due to the acoustic driving. They violently collapse in one cycle and fragment into many smaller bubbles than in turn cavitate. This violent collapse is responsible for the mechanical eects of ultrasounds eects. The latter bubbles gather in a ball-shaped cloud and migrate to pressure antinodes. During their migration, their nonexplosive collapses mainly contribute to activate chemical reactions by producing OH  radicals. Mathematical modelling is performed as a new approach to predict the bubbles ®eld. Through numerical simulation, we determinate emergence sites of mechanically active cavitation bubbles. Calculus are compared with aluminium foil degradation. The modelling of bubble migration allow us to have an insight on the privileged sites of the chemical reactions. Validation of the modelling is made through direct comparison with chemiluminescence photo. All experiments and computations are made in a 28.2 kHz sonoreactor. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Volumetric oscillation of multiple cavitation bubbles in an ultrasonic standing-wave ﬁeld is investigated spatially through the intensity measurements of scattered light from bubbles changing the measuring position in the direction of sound propagation. When a thin light sheet ﬁner than half of wavelength of sound is introduced into the cavitation bubbles, at an antinode of sound pressure the scattered light intensity oscillates. The peak-to-peak light intensity corresponds to the number of the bubbles which contribute to the sonochemical reaction because the radius for oscillating bubbles at pressure antinodes is restrictive in a certain range due to the shape instability and the action of Bjerknes force that expels from the antinode bubbles that are larger than the resonant size. The experimental results show that the intensity waveform of oscillating scattered light measured at the side near the sound source is similar to the waveform as seen in a single-bubble experiment. The peak-to-peak light intensity for the scattered light waveform is low at the side near the sound source where the progressive wave is dominant, while at the side near the water surface far from the sound source the intensity is relatively high and has periodic structure corresponding to the periodicity of half wavelength from the standing wave. These tendencies of high intensity near the water surface and the periodicity correspond to the periodic luminescent stripes seen in images of luminescence in an ultrasonic standing wave as reported by Hatanaka et al. [Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 39 (2000) 2962]. The present method of light scattering is promising for evaluating spatial distribution of violently oscillating cavitation bubbles which eﬀect sonochemical reactions.},

We observe pronounced deformation and elongation of the elastic sphere when the spark-bubble is generated very close to a sphere. This happens when the elastic sphere has a small modulus of elasticity and a small size ratio R’ between the bubble and the elastic sphere (i.e. the bubble and the sphere have similar radii). Numerical simulations are also conducted using a Boundary Element Method (BEM) model coupled with a Finite Element Method (FEM) solver. The simulation results compare well with the experimental data. The numerical model is then extended to study the effects of elasticity and experimental parameters, such as the dimensionless stand-off distance H’, and size ratio R’, on the degree of deformation of the elastic cell and the dynamics of the bubble.},

	abstract = {Populations of small helium gas bubbles were introduced into a ﬂowing mercury experiment test loop to evaluate mitigation of beam-pulse induced cavitation damage and pressure waves. The test loop was developed and thoroughly tested at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) prior to irradiations at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center–Weapons Neutron Research (LANSCE–WNR) facility. Twelve candidate bubblers were evaluated over a range of mercury ﬂow and gas injection rates by use of a novel optical measurement technique that accurately assessed the generated small bubble size distributions. Final selection for irradiation testing included two variations of a swirl bubbler provided by Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) collaborators and one oriﬁce bubbler developed at SNS. Bubble populations of interest consisted of sizes up to 150 lm in radius with achieved gas volume fractions in the 10À5–10À4 range. The nominal WNR beam pulse used for the experiment created energy deposition in the mercury comparable to SNS pulses operating at 2.5 MW. Nineteen test conditions were completed each with 100 pulses, including variations on mercury ﬂow, gas injection and protons per pulse. The principal measure of cavitation damage mitigation was pitting damage assessment on test specimens that were manually replaced for each test condition. Damage assessment was done after radiation decay and decontamination by optical and laser proﬁling microscopy with damaged area fraction and maximum pit depth being the more valued results. Damage was reduced by ﬂow alone; the best mitigation from bubble injection was to one-third that of stagnant mercury. Other data collected included surface motion tracking by three Laser Doppler Vibrometers (LDV), test loop wall dynamic strain, beam diagnostics for charge and beam proﬁle assessment, embedded hydrophones and pressure sensors, and sound measurement by a suite of conventional and contact microphones.},

To address this need, many transfection techniques have been developed including viral, lipoplex, polyplex, capillary microinjection, gene gun and electroporation. The current discussion explores a procedure called optical injection, where a laser field transiently increases the membrane permeability to allow species to be internalized. If the internalized substance is a nucleic acid, such as DNA, RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA), then the process is called optical transfection. This contactless, aseptic, single cell transfection method provides a key nanosurgical tool to the microscopist—the intracellular delivery of reagents and single nanoscopic objects. The experimental possibilities enabled by this technology are only beginning to be realized. A review of optical transfection is presented, along with a forecast of future applications of this rapidly developing and exciting technology.},

	abstract = {A simulation model for bubble motion in a compressible liquid is developed based on the linear wave equation. At the initial stage, the bubble is assumed to be spherical and the wave equation is simpliﬁed as a one dimensional ordinary equation in the radial direction through the prophase approximation. When time becomes much larger than that required for a disturbance to travel across the bubble at the speed of the sound, the obtained integral equation is approximated by keeping the term of the ﬁrst order in terms of the characteristic Mach number, through the anaphase approximation. An equation is introduced to unify the approximations in these two phases, which is then used over the entire simulation period. The problem at each time step is solved by a three dimensional boundary element method. The convergence study has been ﬁrst taken with meshes and time steps. Comparison is made with the analytical solution for spherical bubble in compressible liquid and good agreement is found. Further comparison is made for a bubble in an incoming acoustic wave. Extensive simulations are then made for a bubble in various conditions, including the cases with solid boundary effect, free surface effect, buoyancy effect, as well as for interactions between bubbles. \& 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Purpose. Nd:YAG laser photodisruption with nanosecond (ns) pulses in the millijoule range is an established tool for intraocular surgery. This study investigates tissue effects in cornea, lens, and retina to assess whether picosecond (ps) pulses with energies in the microjoule range can increase the surgical precision, reduce collateral damage, and allow applications requiring more localized tissue effects than can be achieved with ns pulses. Methods. Both ps and ns Nd:YAG laser effects on Descemet's membrane, in the corneal stroma, in the lens, and at the retina were investigated in vitro in bovine and sheep eyes and in cataractous human lens nuclei. For each tissue, the optical breakdown threshold was determined. The morphology of the tissue effects and the damage range of the laser pulses were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. The cavitation bubble dynamics during the formation of corneal intrastromal laser effects were documented by time- resolved photography. Results. The optical breakdown threshold for ps pulses in clear cornea, lens, and vitreous is, on average, 12 times lower than that for ns pulses. In cataractous lens nuclei, it is lower by a factor of 7. Using ps pulses, Descemet's membrane could be dissected with fewer disruptive side effects than with ns pulses, whereby the damage range decreased by a factor of 3. The range for retinal damage was only 0.5 mm when 200 μJ ps pulses were focused into the vitreous. Picosecond pulses could be used for corneal intrastromal tissue evaporation without damaging the corneal epithelium or endothelium, when the pulses were applied in the anterior part of the stroma. The range for endothelial damage was 150 μm at 80 μJ pulse energy. Intrastromal corneal refractive surgery is compromised by the laser- induced cavitation effects. Tissue displacement during bubble expansion is more pronounced than tissue evaporation, and irregular bubble formation creates difficulties in producing predictable refractive changes. Conclusions. The use of ps pulses improves the precision of intraocular Nd:YAG laser surgery and diminishes unwanted disruptive side effects, thereby widening the field of potential applications. Promising fields for further studies are intrastromal corneal refractive surgery, cataract fragmentation, membrane cutting, and vitreolysis close to the retina.},

The effects of various parameters [e.g., pulse repetition frequency (PRF), pulse duration (PD), and gas content of liquid] on the erosion rate and energy efficiency were explored. An Isppa of 9000 W/cm2, PDs of 3, 6, 12, and 24 cycles; PRFs between 1.34 kHz and 66.7 kHz; and gas saturation of 40-55\% and 79-85\% were used. The results show that very short pulses delivered at certain PRFs could maximize the erosion rate and energy efficiency. We show that well-defined perforations can be precisely located in the atrial wall through the controlled ultrasound tissue erosion (CUTE) process.

The principles of cavitation (generation of bubbles in liquids by rapid changes as those introduced by ultrasound) are expounded. When cavity bubbles implode they produce shock waves in the liquid. Components can be damaged by cavitation if it is induced by turbulent flow. These phenomena have important implications, particularly in underwater acoustics (the fastest growing field in acoustics research). Later chapters concentrate on cavitation due to ultrasound. This interdisciplinary research should be of interest to those engaged in research from sonochemistry to the sensitization of explosives. The physical processes involved are explained both by analogy and formulation. In this way, the concepts should be accessible to those of lesser mathematical ability.},

The sharing of the misfit between the Si and the Si1-xGex layers was observed and quantified by double-axis X-ray diffraction.

	abstract = {Residual microscopic bubble nuclei can persist on the order of 1 second following a cavitation event. These bubbles may limit the efficiency of ultrasound therapies such as shock wave lithotripsy and histotripsy, as they attenuate pulses that arrive subsequent to their formation and seed cavitation memory. Here, we explore a strategy for the removal of residual bubble nuclei following a cavitation event, using a low amplitude ultrasound burst to stimulate bubble coalescence. All experiments were conducted in degassed water and monitored using high speed photography. The following general pulse scheme was used: (A) Cavitation Initiation Pulse: A cavitational bubble cloud was initiated by a 1 MHz therapy transducer using a very short intense pulse (P- ¿ 30 MPa); (B) Nuclei Removal Pulse: Residual bubble nuclei were sonicated using a 2 ms pulse from a separate 350 kHz unfocused transducer to stimulate coalescence. Nuclei removal pulses with amplitudes ranging from 0 to 750 kPa were tested; (C) Interrogation Pulse: The presence of residual nuclei following the removal pulse was probed using a second lower amplitude pulse from the therapy transducer sufficient to cause residual microscopic nuclei to expand and be more easily detected via high speed imaging. The backlit area of shadow from expanded bubbles was calculated to quantify the efficacy of nuclei removal. It was found that the control case (nuclei removal pulse amplitude = 0) generated a bubble shadow area of 0.64 ± 0.08 mm2. For nuclei removal pulse amplitudes of 50 to 150 kPa, minimal coalescence was observed in high speed video, and the area of bubbles excited by the interrogation pulse did not differ significantly from control (p¿ 0.08). Pronounced bubble coalescence was observable for nuclei removal pulses ≥250 kPa, with the extent of coalescence increasing with pulse amplitude. Bubble shadow area was significantly reduced relative to control in these cases (p≤ 0.02). We hypothesize that the primary and secondary Bjerknes forces act in concert to produce the bubble coalescence observed in this study. © 2013 IEEE.},

The physics of this instability is analogous to that of the Raman instability, except that the density fluctuation which provides the coupling to the scattered light wave is the density fluctuation associated with a low frequency ion acoustic wave. The chapter shows another instability, which is also associated with the variations of plasma density induced by variations of light wave pressure. Damping of the unstable waves introduces a threshold intensity for instability generation. The instability can be included in the dispersion relation by replacing their fluid description of the ions with a kinetic treatment. Whole beam self-focusing results from the same physical process and can be considered a special case of the filamentation process. Filamentation and self-focusing can also be driven by either thermal forces or relativistic effects.},

Cavitation control may thus be a way to improve lithotripsy. Materials and Methods: High-speed photography was used to analyze cavitation bubble activity at the surface of artificial and natural kidney stones during exposure to lithotripter shockwaves in vitro. Results: Numerous individual bubbles formed on the surfaces of stones, but these bubbles did not remain independent but rather combined to form clusters. Bubble clusters formed at the proximal and distal ends and at the sides of stones. Each cluster collapsed to a narrow point of impact. Collapse of the proximal cluster eroded the leading face of the stone, and the collapse of clusters at the sides of stones appeared to contribute to the growth of cracks. Collapse of the distal cluster caused minimal damage. Conclusion: Cavitation-mediated damage to stones is attributable, not to the action of solitary bubbles, but to the growth and collapse of bubble clusters.},

The developed method achieves high-order accurate solution in smooth regions, while providing oscillation free solutions at discontinuous regions. The schemes are inherently compact in the sense that the central stencils employed are as compact as possible, and that the directional stencils are reduced in size, therefore simplifying their implementation. Several parameters that influence the performance of the schemes are investigated, such as reconstruction variables and their reconstruction order. The performance of the schemes is assessed under a series of stringent test problems consisting of various combinations of gases and liquids, and compared against analytical solutions, computational and experimental results available in the literature. The results obtained demonstrate the robustness of the new schemes for several applications, as well as their limitations within the present interface-capturing implementation.},

	abstract = {Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF–SIMS) has recently been shown to be a valuable tool for cultural heritage studies, especially when used in conjunction with established analytical techniques in the field. The ability of ToF–SIMS to simultaneously image inorganic and organic species within a paint cross section at micrometer-level spatial resolution makes it a uniquely qualified analytical technique to aid in further understanding the processes of pigment and binder alteration, as well as pigment–binder interactions. In this study, ToF–SIMS was used to detect and image both molecular and elemental species related to CdS pigment and binding medium alteration on the painting Le Bonheur de vivre (1905–1906, The Barnes Foundation) by Henri Matisse. Three categories of inorganic and organic components were found throughout Le Bonheur de vivre and co-localized in cross-sectional samples using high spatial resolution ToF–SIMS analysis: (1) species relating to the preparation and photo-induced oxidation of CdS yellow pigments (2) varying amounts of long-chain fatty acids present in both the paint and primary ground layer and (3) specific amino acid fragments, possibly relating to the painting’s complex restoration history. ToF–SIMS’s ability to discern both organic and inorganic species via crosssectional imaging was used to compare samples collected from Le Bonheur de vivre to artificially aged reference paints in an effort to gather mechanistic information relating to alteration processes that have been previously explored using μXANES, SR-μXRF, SEM–EDX, and SR-FTIR. The relatively high sensitivity offered by ToF–SIMS imaging coupled to the high spatial resolution allowed for the positive identification of degradation products (such as cadmium oxalate) in specific paint regions that have before been unobserved. The imaging of organic materials has provided an insight into the extent of destruction of the original binding medium, as well as identifying unexpected organic materials in specific paint layers.},
